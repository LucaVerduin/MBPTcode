"""Non-radiative transfer rates from the quantities a surface layer produces.

    k = (2 pi / hbar) |V|^2 rho_FC

with V the electronic coupling between the two states -- a spin-orbit matrix
element <S1|H_SO|T1> for intersystem crossing, a transfer integral for electron
transfer -- and rho_FC the thermally averaged Franck-Condon weighted density of
states. Everything below is Fermi's golden rule with a different rho_FC:
Marcus-Levich-Jortner treats ONE effective quantum mode explicitly and the rest
of the bath classically, Marcus treats all of it classically.

This is the expression the TADF work has to produce (Samanta, Kim, Coropceanu
and Bredas, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 139, 4042 (2017); the quantum-mode form is
Jortner, J. Chem. Phys. 64, 4860 (1976)). The surface layer supplies four of the
five inputs -- the adiabatic gap from two relaxed minima, lambda by two
independent routes, the Huang-Rhys spectrum and its first-moment effective mode
-- and V is an argument, so the rate is one call the day a spin-orbit element
lands.

WHAT THE SCALE DEMANDS. Reverse intersystem crossing in a multiresonance emitter
runs at 10^6 s^-1 on a gap of 0.02 eV and a coupling of a few tenths of a cm^-1.
50 meV of error in the adiabatic gap is an order of magnitude in the rate, and
so is a factor of three in the coupling: these formulas are exponentially
sensitive to their inputs and are only meaningful on DIFFERENCES between states
of one molecule, where the method's absolute error cancels.

Every energy in and out of this module is in Hartree, the temperature in Kelvin
and the rate in s^-1.

    -sum_k d_k sqrt(omega_k) d/dq_k, and <v+1|d/dq|v> = -sqrt((v+1)/2) has the
