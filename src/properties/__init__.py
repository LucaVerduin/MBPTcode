"""Everything that is computed FROM a potential-energy surface rather than by
one: geometries, vibronic spectra, state labels and transfer rates.

The layer knows one interface, `PotentialEnergySurface` -- a total energy over
the nuclei, its gradient, and the method's own way of rebuilding what it froze
at a reference geometry -- and nothing about how that energy is obtained. A
BSE@GW excitation, a dRPA ground state and a downfolded active-space root are
the same object here, and a surface that has no analytic gradient yet is driven
through `FiniteDifferenceGradient` instead of being excluded.

    surface     the protocol, and the finite-difference gradient wrapper
    optimize    Cartesian RFO/BFGS with the rigid-body directions projected
                out, geomeTRIC when it is installed, and the refreeze outer
                loop that measures the frozen conventions' own drift
    vibronic    normal modes, Huang-Rhys factors by two independent routes,
                adiabatic gaps and the Marcus reorganization energy
    conformers  the torsional minima a soft emitter has, their Boltzmann
                populations, and a property averaged over them
    characters  the whole BSE spectrum at one geometry and its charge-transfer
                weights, for labelling roots; the fragment character of a
                quasiparticle orbital (Pipek-Mezey), following it across
                geometries, and whether it is the lowest-energy process
    rates       Marcus-Levich-Jortner and Marcus golden-rule rates, with the
                electronic coupling as an argument
    spin_orbit  <S_I|H_SO|T_J> over any solver's Casida vectors -- the coupling
                `rates` was written to receive
    nonadiabatic
                <Psi_I|d/dR Psi_J> from overlaps of those same vectors at
                displaced geometries -- the other coupling `rates` needs, and
                the only one here that costs a gradient rather than a property
    surfaces    the ONE entry point that builds a surface from its declared
                physics, records the realization that computed it, and refuses
                a comparison of two that cannot be differenced
    excitations the vertical, emission and adiabatic energies of a state, with
                BOTH surfaces of every difference built from one `SurfaceSpec`
                -- so the functional under the excited state and the functional
                under the ground state cannot be two functionals
    hessian     the nuclear Hessian by central differences of the analytic
                gradient, for a route pyscf's own analytic Hessian cannot serve
    fragment_bse
                the fragment-partitioned Tamm-Dancoff BSE: site and
                charge-transfer diabats, A_eff(Omega_0) = A_PP + Sigma(Omega_0)
                with the rest eliminated exactly, and its resolvent vectors
    diabatic    finite differences of that diabatic matrix, relocalized at
                every displaced geometry: the reference the analytic gradient
                (`src.gradients.fragment_diabatic`) is gated against

`src.Embedding` and its cRPA-embedded surfaces are out of scope for this
repository, so no row here dispatches to one; a spec that names such a surface
is simply not among the combinations `potential_energy_surface` realizes.
