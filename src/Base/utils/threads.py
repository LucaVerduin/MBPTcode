"""Which thread pool owns a stage: pyscf's OpenMP or the BLAS library's.

The two pools spin against each other, and on sixteen cores the split is an
order of magnitude either way: the SCF costs 117.5 s with both pools at sixteen
threads and 9.4 s with BLAS held at one (`get_veff` 10.38 -> 0.63 s, the DF K
1.90 -> 0.04 s), while a 4000^2 GEMM goes the other direction, 0.24 s at sixteen
BLAS threads against 3.36 s at one. So neither one environment setting nor one
thread count serves a whole run, and the choice is per stage: wrap the kernels
whose work is pyscf's own OpenMP -- K, v_xc, the numint grid pass, the libcint
integral passes -- in `blas_single_threaded`, and never the GEMM-dominated ones
(chi0, Sigma, the BSE block action, the Gram and Cholesky of the ISDF fit),
which need every core inside BLAS.

A wrapped region may still hold GEMM-bound stages: the distributed ISDF-K SCF
runs inside the SCF's wrap, and its row fit, its interaction's rows
Z = (M^T V) M and its K builds are numpy GEMMs -- at one thread the fit alone
costs a sixteen-core node three times its wall (98 s against 31.5 s at
pentacene/cc-pVTZ). `blas_full_pool` gives such a stage back the count the
innermost enclosing `blas_single_threaded` found on entry, and leaves the pool
alone where no wrap took one, so the stage runs on one count inside the SCF
and outside it, the count a one-rank reference ran on. A libcint or pyscf pass
nested inside it takes `blas_single_threaded` again and drops to one.

The gain is a contention effect, so it needs cores to appear, and below
`BLAS_WRAP_MIN_THREADS` there are too few to contend over: the wrap buys
nothing and costs its entry, 1-2 ms of rescanning the loaded pools. So the
threshold is IN the context manager rather than at each call site, and every
caller is free to wrap unconditionally.

What that gate protects is bitwise reproducibility on a workstation. Two threads
dropped to one re-associates the sums BLAS itself makes, which is invisible in
an energy and not invisible to a record compared with `==`: wrapping the SCF of
a quasiparticle route audit at two threads moved its `xc_correction_eV` by
1e-16 and failed six of the thirteen checks of the frozen record it is compared
against. Below the threshold nothing is limited and those gates hold.
`min_threads=1` exercises the mechanics where the ambient count is smaller.

The count is PROCESS-global, not thread-local, so only the main thread may move
it: a worker thread entering the wrap would re-associate a GEMM running on a
neighbouring thread mid-flight. That is not hypothetical -- a simulated-rank
test runs every rank in its own thread of one process, and wrapping the static
exchange build unconditionally scattered the excited-state chain's force by
1.3e-08 Ha/Bohr, past the 1e-08 ISDF reproducibility floor it is gated at. Off
the main thread the wrap is therefore a no-op, which costs a real MPI rank
nothing: ranks are processes and each calls this from its own main thread.

A THIRD POOL: numpy's element-wise work. A ufunc runs on the thread that
calls it, so an element-wise stage between the libcint and the BLAS calls --
the ISDF fit's test co-densities, a shell block of them 3 GB at the
chlorophyllide dimer -- runs on one core whatever OMP_NUM_THREADS says, and
more ranks are the only thing that divides it. `row_map` cuts such a stage's
rows over Python threads (numpy releases the GIL inside its loops), as many
as the process's OpenMP pool (`openmp_threads`). Every element is still made
by the one sequence of operations the unsplit call applies to it, and a
maximum is exact in any order, so the result is the same bits at every count.
It moves no library's thread count, so any thread may call it.

threadpoolctl is a SOFT dependency. Absent, `blas_single_threaded` and
`blas_full_pool` are no-ops, `blas_threads` returns None and `openmp_threads`
1: the process keeps whatever its environment set and every result is
unchanged, since thread counts move only the summation order inside BLAS,
never the arithmetic pyscf does.
