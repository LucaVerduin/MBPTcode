"""What a cluster allocation actually holds, read from the job environment.

pyscf's `max_memory` defaults to 4000 MB regardless of what SLURM handed the
job. On a 16-core node (`-c 16`) that default made anthracene
cc-pVTZ keep its 1.8 GB Cholesky-fitted DF tensor in core (SCF 32 s, static
exchange build 2.3 s) while pentacene cc-pVTZ's 6.4 GB tensor no longer fit,
so pyscf streamed it from a scratch file on GPFS at every J/K build instead --
a 13x SCF and a 24x static exchange build for 1.5x the basis. `max_memory`
(`Mole.max_memory`, inherited by `mf.max_memory`) is the one knob both `DF.build`
(`pyscf/df/df.py`) and this repository's own ISDF block budget
(`SingleReference.GW.qp_solve.static_exchange_diagonal`'s `exchange='df-direct'`
path, which reads `0.25 * mf.max_memory` into `block_memory_gb` when the caller
leaves it unset) size themselves against, so raising it is the whole fix.
