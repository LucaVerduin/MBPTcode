"""Distribution of imaginary-time / imaginary-frequency grid points over ranks.

The space-time loops are sums over grid points, so a rank computes the terms it
owns and the results are added: no halo, no ordering constraint, and the answer
is bit-comparable to the serial one up to summation order.

mpi4py is imported ON DEMAND, never at module import time -- the same rule
`linearAlgebra/diagonalization.py` documents at length: `from mpi4py import MPI`
runs MPI_Init at import, and on a node whose interconnect is unusable MPI aborts
the process from C rather than raising, so an import at module scope kills jobs
that never wanted MPI at all.

BEFORE USING THIS, weigh the all-reduce against the compute. On a 1 GbE
interconnect the chi0 all-reduce (nfreq x naux^2) costs more than the compute
it saves at every acene size measured -- 2.3 s against 0.0 s at one ring,
121.7 s against 18.3 s at twelve. Distributing tau across nodes there makes
the calculation SLOWER. That is a property of the FABRIC, not of the split:
the volume is set by the problem, and on InfiniBand the same bytes move two
orders of magnitude faster. Job-level parallelism (one molecule or one state
per node) needs none of this and always scales; `mpi_map` below is that axis
for the loops a driver used to run in one process.

WHICH AXIS TO SPLIT. Tau is where the M^2 sweep is, and every tau point feeds
every frequency, so a tau split always ends in one reduction of (nfreq or
ntau) x naux^2 -- chi0 and proj(tau) -- or npade x nao^2 for the AO
self-energy. Frequency is where a per-point LU is, and a frequency's result
is its own row, so a frequency split needs no reduction; but splitting chi0
over frequency would REPLICATE the tau sweep and save nothing. So: tau for
the sweeps (`polarizability_projected_sweep`, the self-energy, the static W
of the BSE kernel), frequency for the contour-deformation contraction and the
dRPA frequency loop, rows of Zt for the BSE block action. All of them take a
`comm`; every rank runs the whole driver in lockstep and the reductions make
the ranks agree bitwise.

WHAT THE RANKS MUST AGREE ON. A reduction adds the ranks' partials, so the
partials have to be partials OF ONE CALCULATION: every rank's copy of the
inputs it contracts must hold the same bits. That does not happen by itself.
Each rank runs its own SCF and its own ISDF fit, on its own node, with its own
threads, and two runs of the same threaded dense arithmetic on different nodes
are not bit-identical -- measured across two nodes, where
the ranks' interpolation points and eigenvalues drift apart and the reduced
sum is then of terms belonging to different calculations. Worse, a DISCRETE
decision taken from that arithmetic (an auto-sized grid, a pivot count, how
many trial vectors a Davidson keeps) can differ outright, and then the ranks
call the same collective with buffers of different sizes: MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE, or
a deadlock. `replicate` and `lockstep` close the first half -- rank 0's inputs
overwrite everyone's. The second is closed either by a ROOT-DRIVEN iterative
solver, which leaves every decision to rank 0 and lets the other ranks serve
only the partials it asks for, or by `lockstep` at the entry of every kernel,
which makes every kernel's output, and so every decision taken from it, the
same on every rank.

THE DISTRIBUTION CONTEXT. `with distributed(comm):` makes `comm` the current
communicator of everything that runs inside the block on this thread, and
`current_comm()` reads it. Only realization kernels communicate: a kernel takes
`comm=None` and falls back to `current_comm()`, locksteps its inputs, computes
its serial-shaped partial and gathers or all-reduces it. An all-reduced buffer
is identical on every rank by the MPI standard and a gathered one travels
verbatim, so the kernel's output holds the same bits everywhere, and a driver
replicated on every rank (a Davidson loop, an SCF loop, a geometry walk) takes
the same decisions everywhere without carrying a communicator or speaking a
protocol. The context is per THREAD because `run_simulated` runs its ranks as
threads of one process; on a real communicator the block also aborts the job
when an exception leaves it, since the rank that raised will never enter the
collective its peers are waiting in.

Set MBPT_USE_MPI=0 to force the serial path.

`simulated_world(size)` gives `size` communicators that reduce through shared
memory across THREADS of one process. It exists so every distributed path can
be exercised where MPI cannot start -- the sandboxed test runner, a machine
without mpirun -- with the real reduction, not a no-op: each rank runs in its
own thread and `reduce_sum` blocks until every rank has contributed, then
hands all of them the rank-ordered sum. tests/test_mpi_routes.py and
tests/test_mpi_grid_distribution.py under mpirun remain the check that the
wire protocol matches.

    """Rank 0's copy of `x` on every rank, written into every rank's `x`.

    WHY. The ranks' copies of a replicated input are not the same bits: two
    runs of one threaded SCF on two nodes gave orbital
    energies 1.3e-10 Ha apart and orbitals in different gauges. Every
    realization kernel locksteps its inputs at entry, so its partials are
    partials of ONE calculation and its output is identical on every rank;
    every decision a driver then takes from that output is the same on every
    rank, and the replicated drivers stay in lockstep with no protocol.

    comm: defaults to `current_comm()`; None or one rank returns `x` itself,
          untouched and uncopied.
    check: prove agreement before moving anything. Each rank reduces each
           array to `agreement`'s 64-bit digest, the digests ride in the
           allgather that compares the structure anyway, and only an array
           whose digests differ between ranks is broadcast. Pickled leaves
           (scalars, small objects) are broadcast either way.

    WHY CHECK. Where the ranks agree by construction -- trial vectors of a
    Davidson run on an all-reduced action, a density from an all-reduced Fock
    matrix, factors fitted on lockstepped orbitals and points -- the broadcast
    is insurance and a digest is the cheaper proof. At pentacene cc-pVTZ on
    eight nodes the BSE stage's 332 locksteps (664 MB) found
    no rank apart, while broadcasting them raised `davidson_comm` from 0.23 s
    to 3.0 s; the digest runs at 17-18 GB/s (173 MB in 9.8 ms) and sends 8
    bytes an array. A drifted array still shows in its digest and is
    broadcast as unchecked (one changed word always does, several cancel with
    probability ~2^-64), and every rank decides from the same gathered
    digests, so the collectives pair.

    A C-contiguous array is broadcast IN PLACE and returned (the same object);
    any other array through a C-ordered temporary copied back into it. A
    tuple, list, namedtuple or dict is handled element by element, recursively,
    and comes back as the same container type holding the same array objects.
    None stays None; anything else (a scalar, a small object, an object-dtype
    array) is pickled across in one `broadcast` and must be taken from the
    return value. Shapes, dtypes and the container structure must already
    agree on every rank -- these are replicated inputs -- and are checked in
    one allgather first: a disagreement, or a read-only array on a rank that
    would be written, raises ValueError on EVERY rank before any buffer moves.
    A checked call refuses a read-only receiver as well, whether or not the
    digests agree: otherwise the refusal would surface only on the run whose
    ranks drifted.

    This is a collective: every rank calls it the same number of times in the
    same order. Each call adds the array bytes it broadcast to `bytes` in
    `lockstep_stats`; a checked call also counts in `checked_calls` and adds
    the bytes it did not send to `skipped_bytes`. Inside `distributed(comm,
    audit=True)` it compares each rank's copy of every array it broadcast with
    the one it received and counts the calls where any element differed.

    WHY. A kernel's large inputs -- the factors, W, proj(tau), 10 to 27 GB at
    the chlorophyllide hexamer -- come out of upstream kernels that lockstep
    or all-reduce them, so they are identical by construction and a kernel
    does not broadcast them again. This checks the construction instead: each
    rank reduces its copy to a 64-bit digest and one allgather compares them,
    so a run can show that every kernel's inputs and outputs held one set of
    bits on every rank while moving 8 bytes an array.

    THE DIGEST. The C-ordered bytes are read as 64-bit words u_i, the tail
    zero-padded, and summed mod 2^64 against W[i mod L] c[i div L], W and c
    odd words of one PCG64 stream (`AGREEMENT_DIGEST_SEED`, L =
    `AGREEMENT_DIGEST_BLOCK`). A change confined to one word always changes
    the sum, because an odd weight is invertible mod 2^64; changes in several
    words cancel only where their differences stand in the ratio of two
    pseudo-random weights, ~2^-64, which also catches swapped elements. It
    measured 10 to 18 GB/s on a workstation, 26 GB in 1.4 to 2.6 s, where
    blake2b runs at 0.29 GB/s (90 s), sha1 at 0.49 and a 32-bit crc32 at 3.5;
    a sum over a strided sample would miss the one-ulp drift in an unsampled
    element, and that drift is what this looks for. The shapes, dtypes and
    container structure are compared with the digests; any other leaf (a
    scalar, a mapping value) by a blake2b digest of its pickle.

                outputs in an audited run at no cost in a production one. The

    finite-difference gradient, the starts of a conformer search -- which the
    task pool used to be the only way to spread and which the drivers ran in

    spread rather than piled on one rank; the results travel as Python
    objects (mpi4py's lowercase allgather pickles them), so keep them small
    and picklable -- coordinates and numbers, not a Mole. Without a comm it
    is the builtin map.

    The comm here and any comm the mapped function uses inside must not be the
    same one: the ranks call fn on DIFFERENT items, so a collective inside fn
    would pair up mismatched calls. Give the inner chain None, or a
    sub-communicator; fn runs inside `distributed(None)`, so a kernel in it
    that falls back to `current_comm()` runs serially.
