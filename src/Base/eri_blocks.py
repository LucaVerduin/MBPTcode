"""The MO integral blocks the quasi-boson GW/BSE energy actually needs.

The dense quasi-boson route was written against a full (pq|rs), which is nao^4
and becomes the binding constraint long before the physics does: formaldehyde in
aug-cc-pVTZ is 2.9 GB, acrolein 46 GB. But the energy path only ever touches
three blocks --

    ovov   (ia|jb)     the RPA/BSE particle-hole kernel
    oovv   (ij|ab)     the BSE direct term
    pqov   (pq|ia)     the bare boson couplings V^I_pq

-- and every other slice it takes is one of these under the eight-fold
symmetry. `pqov` dominates at norb^2 * nocc * nvirt, which is smaller than
nao^4 by nao^2 / (nocc * nvirt): a factor of 18 for formaldehyde and 19 for
acrolein, taking that 46 GB to 2.5 GB.

`from_dense` slices a full array and reproduces the dense route's numbers
bitwise; `from_mol` builds only the blocks and never forms nao^4 at all. The
two are not bitwise each other: they are different `ao2mo.general` calls, and
on water/cc-pVDZ the (ij|ab) block differs by 4.6e-15 while H4/sto-3g agrees
exactly, so a gate taken on the smallest molecule would not see it.

GRADIENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE from blocks: the correlation gradient contracts a
four-index density against the full tensor. `require_dense` is the refusal, and
the callers use it rather than silently returning something else.

`mo_eri` builds that full tensor from the BARE interaction and consults no
environment, which is what tells it apart from
`pyscf_interface.get_two_electron_integrals_chemist`: the two agree bitwise in
the gas phase and differ by the reaction field v -> v + vtilde wherever an
environment is attached. A route reporting E_c^dRPA[v] uses this one and
refuses a solvated mean field rather than quietly dressing the interaction.

The density-fitted interaction, (pq|rs) = sum_PQ J_pq,P [V^-1]_PQ J_rs,Q, is
here as well: a route that differentiates a FITTED energy has to evaluate that
same fitted energy, so the forward assembly and the three-index gradient
skeleton (`gradients.df_assembly`) read one pair of integral builders.

`g_slice_df` / `g_slice` give one physicist block <pq|rs> from a DF factor
(or a dense chemist tensor), for routes that slice rather than hold blocks.
