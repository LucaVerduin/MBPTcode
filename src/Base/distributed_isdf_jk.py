"""The ISDF-K SCF divided over the ranks: the interpolation points in fixed
tiles, and the auxiliary shells of the integral-direct Coulomb matrix.

WHY. At a six-chlorophyllide hexamer model / cc-pVTZ (534 atoms, nao 12204, naux
31260) the fitted three-centre tensor is 18.6 TB, 37 TB with the second one a
range-separated functional builds, so the mean field's exchange is the ISDF
one (`isdf_jk.ISDFJK`),

    K = X^T [Z o (X Dm X^T)] X,     Z = M^T V M,     X[P, mu] = chi_mu(r_P),

three M^2 x nao contractions on M = 117762 points, and its Coulomb matrix is
pyscf's integral-direct DF-J, which stores no tensor. On one rank that is the
whole SCF, and Z alone is 111 GB.

WHAT A RANK HOLDS. The grid index is cut into the fixed tiles of the
row-distributed fit (`separable_ri.fit_rows`, `FIT_CHOLESKY_BLOCK` points),
owned block-cyclically -- tile t by rank t % size, the fit's own layout, so
M^T never moves. A rank holds, for its tiles: X_t, M^T_t, and per operator
either Z's rows (Z_t = G_t M^T, G_t = M^T_t V, 'dense') or G_t alone, Z's
blocks then formed per build ('factored'). No rank holds X, M, Z or
X Dm X^T whole. V is evaluated by every rank in fixed slabs of auxiliary
shells and never held whole either.

HOW K IS BUILT. The density enters through its occupied factor, since
pyscf tags every density it builds with its orbitals: Dm = C~ C~^T with
C~ = C_occ sqrt(n), so X Dm X^T = Y Y^T with Y = X C~, M^2 nocc and not
M^2 nao (an untagged density takes Y = X Dm, the general form). For every
column tile j in tile order its owner broadcasts [Y_j | X_j (| M^T_j)], and
each rank adds, for each of its row tiles i,

    T_i += [(Y_i Y_j^T) o Z_ij] X_j,         then  K_r = sum_i X_i^T T_i,

so every GEMM has a shape fixed by the tiles, T_i is summed over j in one
order at every rank count, and the rank's partial K_r goes into ONE
reduction with J -- a sum over the grid, re-associated at the rank
boundaries like every Fock partial of the distributed DF SCF.

J. `df_jk.get_j`'s two integral passes, the auxiliary shells cut into
contiguous blocks of about naux / size functions: pass 1 gives each rank
the exact rows of (P|mu nu) Dm_{mu nu} for its shells, gathered verbatim;
the metric solve rho = V^-1 j is every rank's own, locked to rank 0's; pass
2 is each rank's shells' partial of sum_P (P|mu nu) rho_P, reduced with K.

THE DRIVER IS `distributed_df.distributed_mean_field`, unchanged:
`distributed_df_jk` hands an ISDF mean field this handle, which locksteps the
density and its orbitals at entry and reduces its partials, so pyscf's loop
runs on every rank on the same numbers.

THREADS. The driver holds BLAS at one thread for pyscf's OpenMP (`nr_rks` on
the DFT grid, the DF-J passes). The row fit, G and Z's rows and the K builds
are BLAS GEMMs, and the metric's factor and solve LAPACK: each takes back the
pool the driver's wrap took (`threads.blas_full_pool`), so it runs on the
count the process had before the SCF -- the count a one-rank handle built
outside it runs on, which keeps the tiles its tiles bit for bit -- while the
libcint passes inside it (the metric slabs, the fit's three-centre integrals)
drop to one again. `scf_isdf_blas_fit`, `scf_isdf_blas_kernel` and
`scf_isdf_blas_k` record the counts they ran on.

WHAT THE NUMBERS DO. The row fit is another realization of the serial fit's
estimator (not its bits), and the reductions re-associate J and K, so the
distributed SCF lands on the serial ISDF-K SCF within the SCF's own
convergence threshold, the same on every rank.

MEASURED, anthracene/cc-pVDZ/LRC-wPBEh on two workstation threads (M 3552 in 7
tiles, nao 246, naux 924, nocc 47), the one-rank handle: the row fit 12.8
s; one operator's Z rows 0.75 s (31 GF/s); a K build 0.23 s, 34 GF/s on
2 M^2 (nocc + nao) + 2 M nao^2, against 0.32 s for the serial ISDFJK's K on
the density itself; J 1.7 s, pyscf's integral-direct DF-J either way.

SCALED TO THE HEXAMER / cc-pVTZ (M 117762 in 230 tiles of 512, nao 12204,
naux 31260, nocc 1062), per rank, 8 / 16 ranks, Z held for the bare and the
long-range operator (a rank's ~29 / ~15 tiles, ~14720 / ~7360 rows):

11289 s a build on one core, ~90 s / ~45 s where it divides over the 128 /
256 cores. Every K build receives the other ranks' Y and X tiles, 12.5 GB a
