"""The SCF's Fock build divided over the ranks: the auxiliary index of the
density fit, and the points of the exchange-correlation grid.

WHY THE SCF IS THE STAGE LEFT. Every other stage of a GW/BSE run divides --
tau, frequency, the rows of Zt, the screened kernel -- and the mean field does
not: every rank converges the same SCF on the same data, so its wall is what it
was at one rank however many there are. On a 16-core node at 1 rank x 16 threads,
anthracene/cc-pVTZ is 32 s of SCF against 35 s for everything four ranks
divide, and pentacene/cc-pVTZ is 429-448 s against 101 s -- 60% of a rank's
wall spent computing one calculation four times.

Its memory is the worse half. `cderi`, naux x nao(nao+1)/2 doubles, is 1.8 GB
at anthracene and 6.5 GB at pentacene, whole on every rank. At max_memory 4000
MB pentacene's does not fit, so pyscf spills it to disk and streams it back
once per cycle (`pyscf/df/df.py::DF.build`, which picks in-core against
out-of-core on exactly that comparison), and that spill is most of the gap
between the ~100 s the SCF costs in core and the 430 s measured.

WHAT DIVIDES. J and K are sums over the auxiliary index,

    J_{mu nu} = sum_P L^P_{mu nu} sum_{la si} L^P_{la si} D_{la si}
    K_{mu nu} = sum_P sum_{la si} L^P_{mu la} D_{la si} L^P_{si nu}

with L^P the fitted three-index tensor, so a contiguous block of P gives a
partial of both and the partials add. Rank r holds ONLY its block of rows --
`contiguous_block(naux, r, nranks)`, ceil(naux/nranks) of them, tiling the
auxiliary index -- and its partial comes from pyscf's OWN contraction: this
object IS a `pyscf.df.DF` whose stored tensor is the slice, so
`pyscf/df/df_jk.py::get_jk` reads it through `DF.loop` and sums over the rows
that are there, with nothing re-implemented. One reduction adds the ranks'
partials. Per-rank storage is naux_r x nao(nao+1)/2 x 8 bytes: 451 MB per rank
at anthracene on four, 1.6 GB at pentacene on four, where the whole tensor
does not fit at all.

AND THE GRID, WHICH IS THE LARGER HALF. On a hybrid, `nr_rks` costs more than
the fitted exchange it accompanies -- 1.00 s against 0.08 s for K on
naphthalene/cc-pVDZ/PBE0 (`GW/qp_solve.py::static_exchange_mean_field_matrix`)
-- so dividing J and K alone divides a tenth of the time. The grid integral is
a sum over points,

    nelec = sum_g w_g rho(r_g),   E_xc = sum_g w_g rho(r_g) eps_xc(r_g)
    V_g^{mu nu} = sum_g w_g v_xc(r_g) chi_mu(r_g) chi_nu(r_g)

so a contiguous block of points is a partial of all three and the partials
add, exactly as the auxiliary rows do. Rank 0 builds `mf.grids` -- pyscf's own
`Grids.build`, with pyscf's own pruning, and the density-dependent
`prune_small_rho_grids_` its SCF applies on the first Fock build -- and
broadcasts the coordinates and weights ONCE (32 bytes a point: 9.5 MB at
anthracene, 14.3 MB at pentacene). Every rank then takes its block, rebuilds
the screening mask for it (`make_mask` on its own points, since `non0tab` is
indexed in blocks of the array it was made for) and runs pyscf's own
`numint.nr_rks` on a `Grids` carrying nothing else. The blocks are cut in
units of `ALIGNMENT_UNIT` points, because `NumInt.block_loop` turns the sparse
AO kernels off on a grid whose length is not a multiple of it.

THE LONG-RANGE OPERATOR IS A SECOND TENSOR. A range-separated hybrid asks
for the exchange of erf(omega r)/r beside the bare one (LRC-wPBEh: 0.2 of the
bare K and 0.8 of the long-range one at omega = 0.2), and pyscf answers it
from a second fitted tensor, built from the attenuated three- and two-centre
integrals (`pyscf/df/df.py::range_coulomb`). Here that is a second
`DistributedDF` for that omega, built the same way inside the attenuated
operator the first time the SCF asks for it and cut by the same rule into
the rows of ITS metric factor -- the attenuated metric is singular, so it
takes pyscf's eigen-replacement and has fewer rows than the bare one. Its
partials reduce exactly as the bare one's. It doubles a rank's slice.

What the split does NOT buy is the resident grid memory: `block_loop` already
streams the AO values in blocks capped at 1200 x BLKSIZE points and by
max_memory, so the buffer is ~1.2 GB at anthracene and ~1.8 GB at pentacene
whatever the rank count, until a rank's slice falls below one block (past four
ranks at anthracene, past six at pentacene). What falls with the rank count is
the number of blocks a rank walks, which is the time.

Not split: the NLC grid (`nr_nlc_vxc` on `nlcgrids`), integrated on rank 0
alone because VV10 is a double sum over the points and not a sum of blocks;
the density probe `prune_small_rho_grids_` reads, because what it prunes is
the grid rank 0 hands out; and with `split_grid=False` the whole quadrature,
which is the fit's division timed apart from the grid's. Rank 0's result is
shared through the same reduction, the other ranks adding exact zeros.

HOW A RANK GETS ITS ROWS: THE TENSOR IS CUT TWICE. cderi = L^-1 (P|mu nu) with
L the Cholesky factor of the auxiliary metric (P|Q), so row P of the result
reads raw rows 0..P: no factorization of the metric lets a rank evaluate its
own rows from its own auxiliary shells. What a row slice does NOT need is the
whole raw tensor -- only the whole auxiliary extent of the AO-pair COLUMNS in
flight, which is exactly the block `pyscf/df/incore.py::cholesky_eri` forms in
its buffer. So the evaluation is cut by COLUMN and the storage by ROW, and one
exchange turns the first into the second: each rank takes its share of pyscf's
own block list (round-robin, so a round is one block per rank), evaluates
those blocks whole and solves the metric against them, and each round the
ranks trade the row slices of the blocks they just built. Every column is
evaluated by exactly one rank, the whole tensor crosses the wire exactly once
(6.5 GB at pentacene, 1.6 GB per rank on four) and no rank holds more of it
than its slice plus one round.

Leaving the evaluation replicated instead -- every rank walking every block
and keeping its own rows -- costs no wire at all, and it is what the build did
until it was measured: 52 s of a 78 s four-rank SCF at pentacene, invariant in
the rank count, two thirds of the run.

THE LAST BIT OF THE TENSOR BELONGS TO THE BLOCKING, NOT THE SPLIT. How many
columns go into one `solve_triangular` decides how LAPACK blocks the solve, so
cderi is not bit-stable in the width of the blocks: `incore.cholesky_eri` on
ethylene/cc-pVTZ differs from ITSELF by 2.5e-17 between max_memory 4000 and
20. The ranks' slices reassemble bitwise into the same block list walked by
one rank, which is what says the split is exact; against pyscf's default
blocking they sit that same last bit away.

EVERY RANK RUNS THE DRIVER; ONLY THE TWO HANDLES COMMUNICATE. pyscf's SCF loop
runs unchanged on every rank. It takes discrete decisions from its own
arithmetic -- the DIIS extrapolation, the occupation, when it has converged --
and ranks deciding them from last-bit-different numbers fall out of step and
then call the same collective a different number of times. So both handles
`lockstep` their input at entry: `get_jk` and the quadrature write rank 0's
density matrix, and the orbitals and occupations tagging it (both
`df_jk.get_jk` and the rho evaluator read them), into every rank's own arrays
IN PLACE before any partial is formed. The partials are then partials of one
density, the all-reduced J, K and V_xc are the same bits on every rank, and
because the lockstep wrote into the LOOP'S OWN density and orbitals, whatever
pyscf decides next -- the energy, the orbital gradient, the DIIS error vector
-- is computed from the same inputs on every rank. What no per-call lockstep
reaches is the loop's exit, so `conv_tol`, `conv_tol_grad`, `max_cycle` and
`conv_check` are rank 0's from the start, and the converged spectrum,
orbitals, occupations, energy and flag are locked once more at the end, so
every rank returns rank 0's mean field bit for bit even where a node's
eigensolver differed in a last bit. The grid is the one piece not run
everywhere: while the quadrature handle is installed only rank 0's
`initialize_grids` builds anything, and its points reach the others inside the
quadrature, once per epoch.

Per Fock build that is two locksteps of the density and its orbitals, 2 x (2
nao^2 + nmo) doubles, one all-reduce of 2 nao^2 for (J, K) and one of nao^2
for (nelec, E_xc, V_xc): 17.6 MB at anthracene, 41.0 MB at pentacene, against
a stage that costs tens of seconds. The two locksteps are checked
(`mpi_grid.lockstep(check=True)`), so where the ranks agree they send 8 bytes
an array and only the all-reduces carry volume. One-off on top of that, the
metric factor (16 and 39 MB), the grid (9.5 and 14.3 MB) and the fitted
tensor's one crossing (1.8 and 6.5 GB, once).

WHAT THE SCF LEAVES BEHIND. The slices outlive the SCF that built them, on
`mf._distributed`, because the static exchange every quasiparticle route
builds next is the same two operators over the same ranks: one K and one
v_xc on the DFT grid, 7.4 s at pentacene and invariant in the rank count
until it goes through these handles. They are NOT left installed -- a
downstream `with_df.loop()` or a response kernel would read one rank's block
as the whole -- so `distributed_fock` is the bracket that installs them for a
stage and takes them off again. What they hold is this rank's slice, 1.6 GB
at pentacene on four ranks; `release_distributed` gives it back.

WHERE THE WALL CLOCK GOES. A distributed run leaves `TIMING_KEYS` on
`mf._distributed_timings`, filled on EVERY rank, because the question a rank
count raises is not how long the SCF took but which part of it did not divide.
The loop's own work, `scf_driver`, is replicated and the same on every rank;
what a rank cannot spend on its own share it spends waiting inside the
reductions and the locksteps for the slowest rank, `scf_reduce` and
`scf_lockstep`.

WHAT THE NUMBERS DO. The reductions re-associate the sums over P and over the
grid points, so J, K and V_xc differ from the serial ones in the last bits,
and the SCF converges to a mean field that differs at the convergence
tolerance -- not more, because every rank takes every decision from the same
numbers. Gated on water/cc-pVDZ and ethylene/cc-pVTZ at RHF, PBE0 and UKS with
conv_tol 1e-12: energies within 1e-10 Ha of serial, densities within 1e-8,
orbital energies within 1e-8 Ha, and the orbitals identical bit for bit across
ranks.

PYSCF INTERNALS. Three of the names imported below are private to pyscf --
`df.incore._eig_decompose` (the metric factor's eigen-fallback),
`df.outcore._guess_shell_ranges` (the AO-pair column blocks `cholesky_eri`
walks) and `dft.gen_grid.ALIGNMENT_UNIT` (the point count `block_loop` keeps
its sparse kernels on for) -- because the split is exact only if it walks
pyscf's own blocking. They were checked against pyscf 2.12.1, the version the
tests here run on; a pyscf that renames one fails at import, not in a result.
