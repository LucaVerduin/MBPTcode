"""Induced dipoles on classical polarizable sites: the response a QM/MMPol
environment screens with.

A site k carries an isotropic polarizability alpha_k and responds to the field
at its position with a dipole. The dipoles see each other, so they are coupled:

    mu_k = alpha_k ( E_k + sum_{k' != k} T_kk' mu_k' )
    (alpha^-1 - T) mu = E,        B = (alpha^-1 - T)^-1

B is the classical response matrix, (3N, 3N), symmetric, and the whole of what
the environment contributes to a screened interaction:

    vtilde(r, r') = - sum_kk' grad_k v(r) B_kk' grad_k' v(r')

which is the polarizable-embedding analogue of the PCM reaction field, with a
FIELD (dipole) response where the continuum has a CHARGE (surface) one. The
same rank structure follows, so the same cubic adjoint does. The sign is the
reaction field's: the dipole a charge induces attracts that charge, so
vtilde(r, r) = -E^T B E < 0 and v + vtilde is a REDUCED interaction, negative
semidefinite exactly as the continuum's v chi v is.

    T_kk' = lambda5 * 3 r r^T / r^5 - lambda3 * I / r^3,   r = R_k' - R_k

THE DAMPING IS NOT OPTIONAL. Undamped, two sites closer than
(4 alpha_k alpha_k')^(1/6) make (alpha^-1 - T) singular and the induced dipoles
diverge -- the polarization catastrophe (Thole, Chem. Phys. 59, 341 (1981)).
The exponential damping smears each dipole over a width set by its own
polarizability,

    u = r / (alpha_k alpha_k')^(1/6),   lambda3 = 1 - exp(-a u^3),
    lambda5 = 1 - (1 + a u^3) exp(-a u^3)

`a` is the Thole factor; 2.5874 is the value cppe and the standard polarizable
force fields use.

WHAT THE DAMPING DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It keeps T BOUNDED: on two sites of
alpha = 5 at 0.5 Bohr the undamped T_zz is 16.0 and the damped one -0.45. It
does NOT make (alpha^-1 - T) positive definite at every separation -- that pair
stays indefinite below about 2.2 Bohr either way. Real sites sit far outside
that, so the response is stable where it is used, but a site list that puts two
polarizable centres inside ~1 Angstrom of each other is describing something
the model cannot represent, damped or not.

THE SITE-TO-QM DISTANCE IS THE SECOND CATASTROPHE, and no damping touches it:
the field integrals between a site and the QM charge are bare. The folding of W
onto the QM region is exact only because the two subsystems' orbitals do not
overlap, so a site the QM density reaches sits outside the model altogether. It
is refused against MIN_SITE_TO_QM_DISTANCE rather than left to appear
downstream as an indefinite v + vtilde.

WHAT THE SITES ARE WORTH IS SET BY WHAT THEY ARE CALIBRATED TO. A site set
standing in for a molecule has to carry that molecule's polarizability, at the
level of response the route it screens for is built from: the direct RPA for a
GW calculation, not the CPHF value a finite field gives. The two differ by a
third to a half in a small basis, and the difference is the whole error of a
QM/MM partition -- `rpa_polarizability` against `finite_field_polarizability`.
