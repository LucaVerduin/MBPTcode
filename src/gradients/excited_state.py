"""The excited-state potential-energy surface of the cubic BSE@GW gradient.

The gradient chain in `qp_space_time`/`bse_isdf`/`isdf_derivatives` returns
dOmega/dR, the derivative of an EXCITATION energy. A geometry optimization
needs the derivative of the excited state's TOTAL energy,

    E_ex(R) = E_0(R) + Omega(R),     dE_ex/dR = dE_0/dR + dOmega/dR

with E_0 the mean-field ground state, so the ground-state gradient is added
here and never inside the chain. That split matters for what comes after it:
in an ADIABATIC singlet-triplet gap the two states sit at DIFFERENT minima, so
E_0 does not cancel between them and has to be carried consistently.

THE FROZEN CONVENTIONS. The chain fixes seven discrete choices at the
reference geometry -- the quasiparticle set, the frame orientation, the
interpolation pair layout, the Newton branch with the pole guard it steps
around and the seed it starts from, the contour-deformation quadrature sized
against the root-to-pole distance, the residue backend, and the scissor the
orbitals OUTSIDE the set carry -- because each is a discontinuity in the
surface otherwise.
`refreeze` rebuilds all of them at a new geometry with the same settings,
which is how the optimizer in `src/properties/optimize.py` measures the drift
of the surface it walked from the one the fit would choose at the end.

THE SURROUNDINGS enter through the chain's `environment`
(`src.Base.environment`): a polarizable continuum dresses the auxiliary gauge
and adds its static reaction-field operator to the quasiparticle equation,
fixed point charges enter the mean field, the gas phase does nothing. The
energy sees the whole of an environment or none of it, and the gradient asks
the environment for its own adjoints. A continuum supplies both, so a solvated
force is analytic, for a restricted reference and a molecule. An environment
without a derivative says so through `differentiable`, and the chain then
reports energies and refuses forces rather than returning the gas-phase
adjoints, which would be wrong by the whole reaction-field response while
looking reasonable.

THE CASIDA STEP follows production's one memory rule by default
(`solver='auto'`, `bse.solver_choice`): dense while the (A, B) pair fits in
BSE_DENSE_MAX_GB -- every root, in a fixed order, the only form a
finite-difference check should difference -- and matrix-free through
production's ISDF Davidson (`solve_casida_davidson`) above it, for either
spin -- kappa = 0 drops the bare-exchange term from the block action and the
screened term is spin-independent. A named `solver` is not vetoed by the rule:
'dense' at size is a caller paying the memory deliberately. The
adjoint is matrix-free either way, and the static W it differentiates is the
one the Davidson solved with. `bse_adjoint` names its realization:
'explicit' (`bse_backward`) contracts the eigenvectors against the
three-index blocks of `bse_cache`, built at the first reverse call off a
forward pass and kept with it, so an energy never pays for them; 'grid'
(`isdf_bse_adjoint`) is the reverse of the ISDF block action and forms no
three-index block, forward or reverse. The two agree to rounding, not in
the bits.

SLICED FACTORS (`sliced=True`, over more than one rank) reach every stage
as ONE `SlicedFactors`: the Davidson block action reads its rows, and the
static W, the quasiparticle solve, the BSE cache and adjoint, the chi0 adjoint
and the nuclear assembly each gather what they read whole once and drop it,
so between geometries a rank holds its grid rows alone and every number is
the whole layout's bit for bit. A continuum that dresses the interaction is
refused on them at construction: Eq. (18) needs the bare gauge beside the
dressed one. On the row fit (`fit='rows'`) the same stages read the rows the
fit itself built, never a whole fit: bitwise the same at every rank count,
and another realization -- and, where the pair screen drops a pair, another
estimator -- than the replicated fit's (`FrozenFactorization`).

Everything computed FROM this surface -- geometry optimization, normal modes,
Huang-Rhys factors, adiabatic gaps, reorganization energies, rates -- lives in
`src/properties/` and knows only the `PotentialEnergySurface` protocol.

    """Frozen conventions, and the energy and gradient that follow from them.

    `scf_factory(mol) -> mf` is how a displaced geometry gets a mean field; it
    must converge the ORBITAL gradient to ~1e-11 (see `check_scf_quality`).

    `solver='auto'` is production's one memory rule (`bse.solver_choice`,
    resolved in `solver_used`): dense while the Casida pair (A, B) fits in
    BSE_DENSE_MAX_GB, matrix-free above it. It is the default because a pair
    count alone decides nothing -- at a hundred atoms the dense pair is
    terabytes, and under the Tamm-Dancoff form a count rule picks dense
    always -- while at the sizes a finite-difference gate runs the rule
    resolves to the dense route anyway, so the default costs those cases
    neither a number nor an ordering.

    `residue_route='explicit'` takes the real-axis residues of Sigma^c as they
    stand: a residue backend decided per state, or per geometry, is not one
    surface.

    `bse_adjoint` is how the Hellmann-Feynman adjoint of the root is
    realized (BSE_ADJOINTS): 'explicit' through the three-index blocks of
    `bse_cache`, (naux, nocc, nvir) each, built at the first reverse call;
    'grid' closed over the ISDF grid (`isdf_bse_adjoint`), which forms none.
    The same surface: the forward pass does not read it, and the two forces
    agree to rounding.

    `qp_window=2` is the frontier set, QPStates('frontier', 2) by the declared
    name: the two occupied and two virtual orbitals around the gap, widened
    over degenerate blocks. It is what this class solves explicitly, and the
    orbitals outside it carry what `outside` says.

    `outside` decides what the orbitals with no quasiparticle equation of
    their own carry on the BSE diagonal: 'mean-field' leaves each at its
    eigenvalue, 'scissor' adds the frozen shift `calibrate_scissor` reads off
    the explicitly solved roots at the reference geometry. That shift is a
    NUMBER, so d eps^QP_p/dR = d eps_p/dR for those orbitals and the adjoint
    chain carries no term for it. The `scissor` keyword is a different thing:
    a tier for the states INSIDE the set whose pole model is inadmissible.

    Under ranks (`with distributed(comm):`) every rank runs the chain whole
    and the kernels it calls divide the M^2 sweeps of the quasiparticle
    solve and of the static screening -- the tau points of proj(tau) and of
    the quasiparticle solve's adjoint, the contour-deformation frequencies,
    the rows of Zt in the Davidson block action -- and hand every rank the
    same bits. The static-W adjoint's sweep (`chi0_backward`) is not divided:
    every rank runs all of its tau points. What the chain forms on its own
    from them, the three branches that carry (eps_bar, X_bar, D_bar) to the
    nuclei, ends in the one `lockstep` of `FactorChain.nuclear_gradient`, so
    both forces here are rank 0's on every rank; the mean-field force
    `total_gradient` adds is `FactorChain.mean_field_gradient`'s, rank 0's on
    every rank as well.
