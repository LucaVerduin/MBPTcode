"""Derivative couplings d_mn = <Psi_m | d/dR Psi_n> between two BSE roots.

The reference is `src.properties.nonadiabatic.derivative_couplings`, which
differences overlaps of the Casida vectors at displaced geometries and costs
6 natm + 1 GW-BSE solves. This route costs ONE GW-BSE solve.

TWO TERMS, AND NEITHER IS OPTIONAL. With
|Psi_n> = sum_ia X^n_ia(R) |Phi_ia(R)> + Y-part, the nuclear derivative hits the
amplitudes and the configurations separately:

    d_mn = <m| dH/dR |n> / (Omega_n - Omega_m)      amplitudes
         + sum_pq gamma^mn_pq A_pq                  configurations

with A_pq = <phi_p | d phi_q / dR>. Ou, Bellchambers, Furche and Subotnik
(J. Chem. Phys. 142, 064114 (2015)) reach the same split. The first term is the
excitation gradient's own reverse chain seeded with an interstate element
instead of a diagonal one, so the orbital relaxation and the Pulay terms arrive
with it (an excited-state chain's `interstate_gradient`).

THE TWO TERMS SHARE A GAUGE AND IT IS THE CANONICAL ONE. Neither is separately
invariant under an occupied-occupied or virtual-virtual rotation -- <m|dH|n> is
the derivative of a quantity that is identically zero, and what it measures is
how the orbital basis moves. The chain leaves the quasiparticle block DIAGONAL,
which is the canonical condition, so A must be the canonical derivative overlap
and not the symmetric-gauge one. The difference is not small: near-degenerate
virtuals rotate through each other at a rate 1/(eps_a - eps_b), and the
symmetric-gauge form can leave the majority of the coupling on the table.

NO DISPLACED SOLVE ANYWHERE. Writing A = A^sym + kappa with A^sym the
symmetric-gauge part, the canonical condition gives, for p != q inside one
block,

    kappa_pq = [ dF_pq - eps_q dS_pq ] / (eps_q - eps_p) + dS_pq / 2

with dF and dS the derivatives in the FIXED reference MO basis. Contracting
gamma with that turns every energy denominator into a FIXED weight, so the
assembled term carries no 1/(eps_q - eps_p) at all: what multiplies it is dF,
which vanishes with it. The density response inside dF then meets a fixed
matrix, so ONE Z-vector replaces the 3 natm coupled-perturbed solves the
nuclear perturbations would each need. `configuration_coupling` has the
assembly.

It cannot be routed through a moving-basis Fock-partial gradient, despite that
routine taking a full MO Fock partial: it differentiates in the MOVING
canonical basis, where the off-diagonal MO Fock is identically zero at every
geometry, so an off-diagonal gamma contributes nothing to it.

WHAT IS NOT HERE. The ground-to-excited coupling d_0n contracts the
occupied-virtual block of A, which is the coupled-perturbed rotation itself.
Everything ISC, rISC and internal conversion need BETWEEN excited states is
excited-excited.
