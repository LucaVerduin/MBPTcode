"""Space-time RPA screening: the polarizability in imaginary time, then one
cosine transform to the imaginary-frequency axis.

With a separable (ISDF) ERI,

    (ia|jb) = sum_PQ X_o[P,i] X_v[P,a] Z[P,Q] X_o[Q,j] X_v[Q,b]

the particle-hole bubble separates into an occupied and a virtual half that each
carry only ONE orbital index,

    Pi_PQ(i.tau) = G^o_PQ(tau) * G^v_PQ(tau)          (elementwise)
    G^o_PQ(tau)  = sum_i X_o[P,i] X_o[Q,i] e^{+eps_i tau}
    G^v_PQ(tau)  = sum_a X_v[P,a] X_v[Q,a] e^{-eps_a tau}

so a tau point costs O(M^2 (n_occ + n_vir)) -- two GEMMs and a Hadamard product
-- against O(naux^2 n_occ n_vir) per frequency for the direct summation in
`imaginary_frequency.py`. That is the N^3-against-N^4 step, crossing over near
120 basis functions.

The transform is used one way only, on the model space it is fitted for
(Pi(i.tau) is a sum of e^{-Delta_ia tau} with Delta_ia in [e_min, e_max]), so
the minimax transform's lack of matrix duality costs nothing.

Sign convention follows `imaginary_frequency._f_rpa`: f(i.w) = -2 d/(d^2 + w^2)
and chi0 = 2 (C_ov f) C_ov^T; the cosine transform maps e^{-d tau} to
2d/(d^2 + w^2), hence the leading -2 below.

ONE KERNEL FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE CODE. `polarizability_projected_tau` is the
N^3 sweep, and it is the only implementation of it: the energy routes stream
it into chi0 here, and the gradient chain
(`gradients.space_time_adjoint.polarizability_tau`) runs it over every tau
point through `polarizability_projected_sweep` and keeps the result whole,
because every contour-deformation frequency is a fixed linear combination of
proj(tau) and the adjoint lands back on an array of that shape. The reverse
pass mirrors this kernel's tiling block for block. A change to the arithmetic,
the tiling or the tau partition therefore reaches both, and
tests/test_space_time_shared_kernel.py pins the two callers to each other.
`polarizability_projected_rows` is the same sweep held by AUXILIARY ROWS over
the ranks (`ProjRows`), which is how the quasiparticle solves keep it: each
rank its rows of every tau slice, every transform over tau made one auxiliary
row per call so that a row is the same bits at every rank count.

THE GRID-ROW SPLIT. A tau split leaves every rank past ntau idle and hands each
rank whole (naux, naux) slices of every frequency. `chi0_frequency_rows`
splits the (tau point, grid-row tile) pairs of the sweep instead, the tiles
being the serial kernel's (`polarizability_tiles`), so the work divides past
ntau ranks and a rank forms only its tiles' (rows, M) Green's-function blocks.
proj(tau) is then a SUM over the ranks' tiles, reduce-scattered to auxiliary
rows (re-associated, the one reduced sum of the sweep), and chi0(i.nu) is
accumulated on those rows with the serial elementwise update, so every row of
chi0 is the serial update of its proj rows, bitwise.

`three_index_slice`, `b_block` and `three_index_ov` sit here for the same
reason: one bra state's pair density, an arbitrary index block and the
particle-hole block are the forward halves of the three-index chain, read by
the contour-deformation energy route and the gradient chain alike, while their
adjoints stay in `gradients.space_time_adjoint` and `gradients.bse_isdf`
beside the rest of the reverse pass.

`rpa_correlation_energy_space_time` is the dRPA energy's own forward sweep, and
`want_tape=True` hands back what a reverse pass through it consumes --
proj(tau) and the two partitions it was built on, so a reverse pass over ranks
splits exactly as the forward sweep did. The gradient's
`space_time_adjoint.rpa_energy_and_adjoint` calls it rather than sweeping
again, so there is one E_c^dRPA in the code and the adjoint cannot drift from
the energy it differentiates.

    chi0(i.nu) = sum_tau cosft[nu, tau] proj(tau), W at a real frequency
    below the gap likewise -- so a rank transforms its own rows, and what
    needs a whole matrix gets one frequency or one tau point at a time: the
    rank that factorizes a frequency gathers that chi0, the rank that sweeps a

    projbar lives in the same rows (`zeros_like`, `fold`). The grid-row split

    """(ks, chi0 rows) over the frequency axis, block by block.

    ks are the frequencies of the block this caller owns -- all of them when
    `freq_indices` is None -- and the rows are sum_tau cosft_wt[ks, tau]
    proj_tau for exactly those; a block with no owned frequency is skipped
    outright. The frequency axis of the contour deformation is the one whose
    per-point work is a naux^3 factorization and whose results are per point,
    which is what makes it the reduction-free axis to split.

    EVERY ROW IS THE SERIAL ROW, on any BLAS. A GEMM row is not a function of
    that row alone: OpenBLAS picks its tail kernel and its threading from the
    call's shape, so rows a rank transforms on their own differ from the
    serial block's in the last bits: on water/cc-pVDZ at 3 of 24 frequencies a
    rank, OpenBLAS moves 30% of the contour-deformation wc by 1 to 224 ulp
    where MKL moves none, enough to break bitwise quasiparticle roots. So every
    serial block holding one of the caller's frequencies is transformed with
    the serial call and the owned rows are compacted to its front, in place;
    one rank is that call alone. An output partition over frequencies therefore
    gathers to the serial result bitwise, while a sum over frequencies still
    re-associates.

    Each row a rank transforms and does not own costs 2 ntau naux^2 flops
    against the (2/3) naux^3 factorization it pays per frequency it owns, a
    fraction 3 ntau / naux per row, and the peak stays the serial block.

    proj_tau may be `ProjRows`: then every block is yielded on every rank --
    each holds rows of every frequency, so each takes part in every gather --
    with its owned frequencies' chi0 gathered whole (`ProjRows.blocks`), ks
    empty where it owns none.

    one block at a time (`owned_frequency_blocks`), so the axis is never whole
    and the peak is proj(tau) plus one block.

    screening = (N, g): the interaction that builds the LOGARITHM is rescaled
    to v + g(w) vtilde while D stays in the dressed gauge. In that gauge the
    rescaling is a similarity on chi0 alone -- with N = V_d^(-1/2) vtilde
