"""Matrix-free Casida/RPA/BSE Davidson, with two ways of applying the same A/B.

`solve_bse_isdf` and `solve_bse_df` are the two production drivers on them --
mean field in, excitations out -- and share every convention, so they differ
only in how the interaction is represented.

The DF route contracts pyscf's three-index factor directly. What sets its cost
is `apply_exchange_direct`, which needs a (naux, nvirt, nvirt) intermediate --
the array that caps system size.

The ISDF (separable-RI) route replaces those contractions by Fock-like builds on
the interpolation grid. With

    (pq|W|rs) = sum_kk' X[k,p] X[k,q] Zt[k,k'] X[k',r] X[k',s],  Zt = D W_aux D^T

each block action is a few GEMMs and one Hadamard product,

    P[k,k']  = sum_jb X_o[k,j] z[j,b] X_v[k',b]     the trial vector as a
                                                    transition density on the grid
    [K z]_ia = sum_kk' X_o[k,i] (Zt * P)[k,k'] X_v[k',a]

so O(M^2 (n_occ + n_vir) + M n_occ n_vir) per trial vector, with no
(naux, nvirt, nvirt) array anywhere. This is the BSE counterpart of the GW
self-energy build in `GW/imaginary_time.py::self_energy_matrix_imaginary_time`,
taken statically at omega = 0. Foerster and Visscher, JCTC 2022,
doi 10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00531 do the same
with PADF in place of ISDF.

The auxiliary GAUGE is the trap. pyscf's cderi is L^-1-whitened while a
separable RI fits with the symmetric V^-1/2, and the two differ by an orthogonal
rotation of the auxiliary index. A W_aux from one paired with factors from the
other is silently wrong -- every intermediate still looks self-consistent, and
in the GW work the same mistake moved a quasiparticle energy by 1.4 eV while
Sigma(i.omega) still agreed to 1e-5. `isdf_bse_factors` returns X, D and W_aux
from a single fit, which is the only reliable way to keep them in one gauge.

The Davidson GUESS is the trap the two routes share, and it is silent in the
same way: one unit vector per requested root returns `nroots` roots that all
report converged and are not the lowest ones whenever the smallest
orbital-energy differences are degenerate. See GUESS_FACTOR.

Where this reaches. On a large molecule the DF route needs an
(naux, nvirt, nvirt) array per trial vector and an (naux, n_occ, n_vir) one
for its static W; the separable route holds the (M, M) Zt instead and takes
its W from imaginary time. Zt spread across ranks is the row split of
`isdf_block_action`.

Over ranks the Davidson and the (A-B) probe run on every rank alike. MPI lives
inside the realization kernels alone: the block action locksteps its trial
vectors at entry and gathers or all-reduces every term it returns, so its
output is the same on every rank; and the Davidson's trial space is cut by
pair rows (`trial_space`), its sums over the pair index reduced and its new
batch gathered, so every decision the iteration takes is read off the same
small matrices on every rank.

#: are block diagonal over it, so the Davidson subspace never leaves the irreps
#: its guess started in: it converges, to `nroots` roots that are not the lowest
#: ones. benzene/cc-pVDZ RPA at nroots=5 puts a degenerate quartet plus half of

    reports internally stable there while (A-B) here is indefinite
    (-0.005 Ha) -- the SCF Hessian under real singlet rotations is a different
    condition from response-metric positive definiteness.

    The probe is a property of the REFERENCE, not of the molecule. Twisted
    ethene has (at least) two converged RHF solutions 31 mHa apart, and
    pyscf's default minao guess can land on the HIGHER one, where min eig(A-B)
    is far more negative (TDHF -0.067 vs -0.005 on the lowest solution; a
    "7x screening deepening" and a "sign flip" were both artifacts of
    comparing across solutions). On both solutions the screening moved the
    minimum UPWARD, consistently. WHICH guess finds the lowest solution is
    itself system-dependent: on the acenes (multi-solution from a6, spreads
    up to 107 mHa) minao lands on the LOWER of three and '1e' is the outlier
    -- the reverse of ethene. So compare E_SCF across initial guesses rather
    than trusting any one; probe the reference you will actually use, with
    the kernel you will actually use; and if the probe comes back negative,
    establish that the SCF is the lowest solution before concluding the
    system itself is unstable.

    Spin does not enter: kappa (ia|jb) is the same term in A and B, so it cancels
    out of the difference and a triplet has the same (A - B) as its singlet.

    comm: the communicator the ISDF action divides its rows over, by default
    the current `distributed` region's; every rank then runs the same Lanczos
    and returns rank 0's value (`_lowest_amb_from_action`).

    Standalone the probe has no converged roots to try first, so it starts
    cold, from 1/d; `solve_bse_isdf` runs it after its Davidson instead, on
    the Davidson's own action, and under 'sign' tries the roots first.

        `self_consistency='evGW'` was not used. The two differ: on water

        screening and the diagonal match and drift -65 meV when they do not,
        which is the size of the choice.

        QUASIPARTICLE ENERGIES PLUS A FURTHER SHIFT are neither, and are the
        easier mistake: evGW energies carrying a static reaction-field
        correction on top are not the evGW spectrum, so screening at them
        satisfies no convention -- 119 meV on acrolein's n->pi*. Leave the
        default and let the reference object carry the spectrum.

        Neither value touches `qp='G0W0'`, whose W comes from the GW step's own
        chi0 at mean-field energies, nor `self_consistency='evGW'`, which always
        screens at its fixed point.

    qp: 'G0W0' (default) puts every quasiparticle energy from ONE space-time
    self-energy on the BSE diagonal (`solve_qp_diagonal_space_time`, which
    applies <Sigma_x - v_xc> per state for a KS reference); an ARRAY of
    energies is used as the diagonal directly (an evGW result, say, or the
    G0W0 diagonal a caller already solved, handed over with `W_aux`);
    False/None solves BSE@mean-field.
    spin: 'singlet' (kappa = 2) or 'triplet' (kappa = 0); the screened term is
    spin-independent, so both read the same W.
    probe: measure min eig(A-B) AFTER the Davidson, on its own block action,
    and refuse the roots while it is negative -- the instability regime, where
    the omega^2 reduction the roots come from is invalid. An unstable
    reference is usually refused sooner, by the Davidson itself: its projected
    (A-B) block stops being positive definite, and the probe that breakdown
    runs names the reference. True converges the eigenvalue by the Lanczos
    from 1/d, the general probe. 'sign' stops as soon as the sign is PROVEN
    by the residual bound, which is all the refusal reads: first by
    Rayleigh-Ritz on the span of the roots' X - Y, one block action per
    root, then by a Lanczos from the lowest root with PROBE_START_MIX of 1/d
    at 1e-2, then from 1/d at escalating tolerances. The roots' certificate
    proves an eigenvalue of (A-B) in their span positive, not the minimum
    over pair irreps no root lies in. A converged probe from 1/d can cost a
    large share of the run, second only to the solve it guards, to establish
    a sign. False skips it, which is reasonable only on a reference already
    probed: the quantity is a property of the SCF SOLUTION, not the molecule.
    gw_kwargs: forwarded to `solve_qp_diagonal_space_time` (the shared factors
    are always passed).
    sigma_x_matrix: <p|Sigma_x - v_xc|q> already built for this mean field, the
    way `factors` is handed in. It is a functional of the density and the
    orbitals alone, so one build serves this BSE, a quasiparticle window the
    caller ran before it, and every evGW cycle -- and none of the three is what
    makes it expensive: one K plus the xc potential on the DFT grid, which no
    window size divides. Left None the GW stage builds it once here, before
    the spectrum starts moving, and hands it to every cycle; the build is
    timed as its own `sigma_x` stage.
    W_aux: the kernel's static screening W(omega = 0) on `factors`, already
    built -- `extras['w_static']` of the `solve_qp_diagonal_space_time` call
    whose diagonal is handed in as `qp`. That call is the one `qp='G0W0'`
    makes here, so a caller that ran its GW stage that way hands over both and
    gets the same roots bit for bit without a second chi0 and self-energy
    sweep. Refused beside `qp='G0W0'`, `self_consistency='evGW'` and
    `screen_at='qp'`, which each build their own W.
    distribute, comm: split the M^2 work over the ranks of `comm`, by default
    the current `distributed` region's. None (the default) follows that
    communicator; True also falls back to COMM_WORLD; False gives this call no
    communicator of its own (no replication, no COMM_WORLD), while the kernels
    it calls still follow a `distributed` region around it -- a serial solve
    inside one is `with distributed(None):`. What is divided is the tau axis of
    chi0 and Sigma in the GW stage and of the static W, and the ROWS of Zt in
    the block action, so the one M^2 object's per-rank memory falls with the
    rank count. Exact up to summation order; one rank prints.

    THE ANSWER IS RANK 0's. Everything the ranks contract into a reduced sum
    is replicated from rank 0 first -- the mean field, the ISDF factors, the
    quasiparticle diagonal and the static W -- and their own copies are
    overwritten, because partials of two slightly different calculations do
    not add. The Davidson and the (A-B) probe then run on every rank on the
    block action's lockstepped output, and their results are lockstepped from
    rank 0 at the end, as is the probe's decision whether the roots alone
    proved the sign. THE TRIAL SPACE IS SIZED FROM THE JOB'S MEMORY: inside a
    SLURM allocation from `mf.max_memory`, which a job sets to the
    allocation's share, less the block action's working set, counted on the
    pair rows a rank holds (`_trial_space_memory`); outside one within
    DAVIDSON_SPACE_GB. On a slow interconnect weigh the GW stage's
    all-reduce of nfreq x naux^2 first: on 1 GbE it cost more than it saved
    (`Base.utils.mpi_grid`).
    grid_accuracy: the named way to ask for the interpolation grid -- an
    accuracy level of `ISDF_GRID_ACCURACY`, measured on exactly this quantity
    (the three lowest BSE roots against `solve_bse_df`), or four explicit shell
    counts. It reaches `separable_factors`, sets `counts` and `n_start`
    together, and aborts on anything the radii table has not got.

    progress: stamp each stage to stdout as it begins and ends, so a job that
    is going to take hours says which stage it is in WHILE it is in it.
    The returned timings only arrive if the run finishes, which is exactly the
    case that does not need them. None follows `mol.verbose`, so the one knob
    that already turns on the mean field's output turns on this too rather
    than leaving a second one to forget.

    preconditioner: the diagonal the Davidson's corrections divide by, 'bare'
    (the pair energies d) or 'screened' (d - (ii|W|aa) in the fit's own
    gauge, one reduction of this rank's grid rows' partial); refused before
    the mean field is touched when it is neither (`_run_davidson`).

    Returns (omega, X, Y, info); info carries eps / eps_mf / factors / W_aux /
    min_eig_amb (under 'sign' the Ritz value whose sign was proven, an upper
    bound on the minimum, not the minimum), length-gauge oscillator_strength
    and transition_dipole per root (`oscillator_strengths`),
    exciton_descriptors, per-stage timings in seconds and `nranks`; `stats`
    holds the probe's record, `probe_source` ('roots', 'lanczos-warm',
    'lanczos-cold') and `probe_matvecs` among it. The Davidson stage carries
    its own breakdown beside its total -- the block action, the subspace work,
    the collectives and the lockstep volume, and the iteration counts, the
    same keys serially and under a comm (`_run_davidson`). The `qp` stage
    carries its own breakdown too, whenever `qp='G0W0'` or
    `self_consistency='evGW'` runs the space-time solve: `qp_chi0`,
    `qp_dyson`, `qp_sigma`, the exchange build `qp_static` and the per-state
    root search `qp_states` (`_QPStageTimings`, summed over evGW's cycles,
    whose count is `qp_cycles`).

    the eigenvalue loop, `gw_kwargs` going to `evgw_eigenvalues` (its own
    keywords and the Casida step's; `screening` is refused, the loop here is
    evGW). The static W is built from the same three-index
    factor: at the MEAN-FIELD spectrum for `qp='G0W0'`, the standard G0W0-BSE
    split, and at the fixed point under evGW, since that is the spectrum the

    W_aux in whatever gauge its `coeff_df` came in, so W_aux is built here from
    the separable factors themselves and never from pyscf's cderi -- see the
    module docstring for what pairing the two costs.

    eps: orbital energies the RPA screening is built at, defaulting to the mean
    field's. A BSE@GW run passes the quasiparticle energies to
    `solve_casida_davidson` through `lr_solver.eps`, but W is normally still the
    G0W0 one, i.e. RPA at the mean-field energies -- so the two are separate
    arguments on purpose.
    counts: Lebedev sub-shell replica counts, i.e. the grid size -- the knob the
    factorization error responds to. The radii come from the one shipped table,
    looked up per element at these counts; nothing is substituted for a caller
    who named no size, so the published Duchemin-Blase cc-pVTZ grids are
    reached by asking for their counts rather than by default.
    grid_accuracy: the same grid asked for by NAME -- an accuracy level of
    `ISDF_GRID_ACCURACY` or four explicit shell counts (`resolve_isdf_grid`),
    which refuses instead of substituting.
    factors: pre-built (X_mo, D), to reuse a factorization across states, or
    `SlicedFactors` over `comm`: the sweep gathers what it reads whole once,
    and the return is then (the sliced factors, None, W_aux) -- D is whole
    for W alone and is not handed back.

    screening:
      'imaginary-time'  chi0(i.0) built from the separable factors in imaginary
            time by `LinearResponse/space_time.py`, which is tiled and cubic and
            touches nothing bigger than (naux, naux). The only route that
            reaches production sizes. `static_screening_matrix` on
            `static_screening_grid`, so any other consumer of the same static
            screening builds it identically.
      'df'  chi0 from the three-index factor these factors imply. Exact for the
            given factors, and the reference the imaginary-time route was
            checked against -- 1e-8 relative on the W entries at ntau=18 on
            water and ethene / cc-pVDZ -- but it forms B and then a
            (naux, n_occ, n_vir) array. Small systems only.

    ntau: imaginary-time points; 'auto' (the default) sizes the grid from the
    Kaltak-Klimes-Kresse test integral over the chi0 transition range at
    `tau_target`, exactly as the GW space-time route does -- but over that one
    range alone, since nothing here transforms a self-energy. More points are
    monotonically safe and then stop paying: measured against the 'df'
    reference on water / cc-pVDZ, W(i.omega = 0) is off by 4.6e-7 at ntau=12,
    1.0e-8 at 18, 2.5e-10 at 24 and 1.8e-10 at 34, the last two sitting on the
    tabulated coefficients' own precision.
    distribute, comm: split the tau points over the ranks of `comm`, by
    default the current `distributed` region's (None follows it, True also
    falls back to COMM_WORLD, False takes none -- as in `solve_bse_isdf`),
    replicate the mean field, the factors and `eps` from rank 0 before the
    grid is sized from them, and all-reduce ONE (naux, naux) matrix. This is
    the best compute-per-byte sweep in the code: every tau point is an M^2

    """The same A/B action from a separable RI -- Fock-like builds on the grid.

    Nothing here carries a (naux, nvirt, nvirt) array, and the only object that
    scales as M^2 is the screened kernel Zt, built once. Everything else is
    TILED over grid rows, because every contraction is a sum over them:

        [K z]_ia = sum_k X_o[k,i] sum_k' (Zt * P)[k,k'] X_v[k',a]

    so a row block contributes X_o[blk]^T (Zt[blk] * P[blk]) X_v and the M x M
    Hadamard product is never formed. The tiling is free -- same flop count,
    same GEMM shapes -- and holds one (M, M) array where the whole product
    would hold three. Zt itself is the wall past that, and the same row
    decomposition is what distributes it across ranks.

    comm: with an MPI communicator, by default the current `distributed`
    region's, this rank builds and holds ONLY ITS
    CONTIGUOUS BLOCK OF ROWS of Zt (`contiguous_block`), M^2 / nranks, and the
    row loop runs over that block alone; the product that builds those rows is
    reassociated so its intermediate follows them (`_screened_rows`), the setup
    being the one place a replicated object is as large as the rows themselves.
    Both exchange terms are sums over the row index -- X_o[blk]^T (...) for A
    and, through U, for B -- so each rank produces a partial (n_occ, n_vir) per
    trial vector and ONE all-reduce of the batch, nvec x n_occ x n_vir doubles
    per term, completes them, against the M^2 n_occ flops it stands for.

    THE HARTREE TERM RIDES THE SAME REDUCTION. Its last contraction,
    X_o^T (u X_v), is a sum over the same grid rows; whole, it would be the
    only piece a rank count did not divide. Split over the rows it costs one
    more (n_occ, n_vir) slab in the batch and no extra collective.

    NOTHING ELSE RUNS AT FULL GRID LENGTH EITHER, which is what a rank count
    has to divide for the action to keep scaling. Three pieces read or write
    the whole grid index and each takes the split that fits its shape:

      z X_v^T is an OUTPUT PARTITION -- a rank builds only the grid rows it
        owns, M n_occ n_vir / nranks flops, and one all-gather of M x n_occ
        doubles (`allgather_blocks`) gives everyone the whole thing, which the
        exchange needs. Gathered, not summed: every row is computed once, by
        its owner, so the ranks hold identical bits and no summation order
        enters.
      p and p D are a REDUCTION -- p is a per-grid-point quantity, so a rank
        forms its own rows of it and contracts them with its own rows of D;
        only the naux-long p D crosses, against the M naux flops it removes.
      X_o^T (Zt * P) X_v is a partial over the rows in its FIRST index and
        whole in its second, and a rank contracts only its own columns of it
        with its own rows of X_v. So the (n_occ, M) partial is REDUCE-
        SCATTERED (`reduce_scatter_rows`): each rank receives the summed
        (n_occ, its columns) block alone, one partial's worth of traffic
        where an all-reduce of the whole moved two, and never holds the rest
        of the sum. The partial is laid out straight into owner order,
        rank s's columns filling rows [s0, s1) of an (M, n_occ) buffer, so
        the GEMMs are the ones an all-reduce read. A block's first tile is
        copied in, the accumulation's first step 0 + x = x but for the sign
        of an exact zero (`_owner_write`), so no memset precedes it and a
        rank whose grid rows fit one tile -- every rank, once enough ranks
        share the grid -- writes its partial once; later tiles add in. The
        partial is n_occ M doubles per trial vector against the
        n_occ M n_vir flops it stands for.
        Contracting X_v first instead would need no reduce at all and costs
        M n_vir per row in place of n_occ M -- more, since the virtual space
        is the wide one.

    The partials sum in rank order rather than in one GEMM, so a distributed
    run agrees with the serial one to the last bits, not in them.

    THE OUTPUT IS THE SAME ON EVERY RANK BY CONSTRUCTION, which is what lets
    the Davidson and the probe run replicated. The trial vectors are
    lockstepped at entry, rank 0's written into every rank's in place by one
    `lockstep` per batch, and the pair diagonal once here, since d z is the
    one term no collective touches; every other term is gathered or
    all-reduced. A rank whose own iteration drifted by a last bit is handed
    back rank 0's vectors rather than applying its own. The batch lockstep is
    checked (`mpi_grid.lockstep(check=True)`): every rank iterated on this
    action's identical output, so a digest proves the batch is rank 0's and
    only a drifted one is broadcast.
    Serial (comm None or one rank) is bitwise unchanged: the row block is then
    the whole grid and every expression is the one it replaces.

    THE ELEMENT-WISE PASSES RUN ON THE PROCESS'S THREADS. A numpy ufunc runs
    on the thread that calls it, so the Hadamard product with Zt (rows x M
    elements a tile), the owner-order write (M n_occ a tile) and the batch's
    d z and slab updates (nvec n_occ n_vir) would each stream on one core
    while BLAS holds the rest idle. `row_map` cuts each over rows on as many
    threads as the OpenMP pool (`openmp_threads`); every element is still
    the one operation the unsplit call applies to it, so the output is the
    same bits at every thread count. These passes are memory-bound, so a
    second thread shortens them by less than half, and the owner-order write
    as a copy is cheaper than a memset followed by adds.

    `SlicedFactors` in `isdf_factors`: this rank's rows are all the action
    reads of X_v and D once Zt is built, so it holds only those; D is gathered
    whole once for the Zt product and dropped with it, and X_o, which
    (Zt * P) X_o reads whole, is gathered once. The Davidson then holds its
    rows of the factor arrays instead of X_mo, X_ao and D whole plus the X_o
    and X_v copies, and the gathered arrays are the replicated ones, so the
    output is bitwise the replicated-factor action's.

    The returned action carries `comm_clock`, a `_CommClock` credited with the
    wall seconds of the lockstep, the gather and the reductions of every
    application, which the Davidson reports as `davidson_comm`, and
    `piece_clock`, a `_PieceClock` credited with the seconds of each piece of
    its local work (ACTION_PIECES), reported as `davidson_action_<piece>`.

    It also carries `screened_diagonal()`, the screened direct term's own
    diagonal taken off d in the fit's gauge,

        (ii|W|aa) = [D^T (X_o o X_o)]^T W [D^T (X_v o X_v)]

    formed only when a Davidson preconditions with it
    (`_preconditioner_diagonal`): the fitted squares are a sum over the grid
    rows, so each rank adds its rows' tiles (DAVIDSON_DIAGONAL_TILE) and ONE
    reduction of (naux, n_occ + n_vir) completes them, naux (n_occ + n_vir)
    doubles against M naux (n_occ + n_vir) / nranks multiply-adds; the
    (n_occ, naux) (naux, naux) product and the last contraction,
    n_occ naux (naux + n_vir) multiply-adds, are replicated.

    vectors at entry and gathers or all-reduces every term it returns
    (`isdf_block_action`), so every rank's iteration reads the same numbers and
    takes the same decisions, with no protocol between them. The roots,
    vectors, flags, cycle count and pair-space record are lockstepped once at
    the end, so every rank returns rank 0's even had its own subspace
    eigensolve, or the dense completion of a solve whose pair space ran out,
    differed in a last bit; ranks whose iterations had fallen apart meet that
    lockstep against another rank's block-action lockstep and raise ValueError
    together instead of deadlocking.

    iterations to get there. Counting the action separately from everything
    around it distinguishes "make the action faster" from "give it a better
    guess", which are different pieces of work.

    timings: optional dict, filled with the same `davidson_*` keys serially and
    under a comm, so a rank count's scaling can be read term by term rather
    than off one total -- `davidson_block_action` is what a rank count
    divides, `davidson_comm` the part of it and of the final lockstep spent in
    collectives, `davidson_lockstep_mb` what the locksteps moved and
    `davidson_lockstep_skipped_mb` what their digests proved every rank held
    already (the trial vectors and the result are checked locksteps),
    `davidson_subspace` what every rank runs whole, and `davidson_iterations`
    with `davidson_vectors_applied` the work the guess asked for.
    `davidson_subspace_max` is the largest trial subspace in pairs,
    `davidson_max_space` the bound real_eig collapses it at, one number on
    every rank, and `davidson_collapses` how often it did
    (`_trial_space_memory`); `davidson_space_budget_mb` is what this rank's
    budget let its holders take and `davidson_action_working_mb` the block
    action's working set it was sized beside.
    `davidson_comm_<kind>` splits `davidson_comm` by collective (COMM_KINDS),
    which says whether the digest, a broadcast or the action's reductions
    carry it. `davidson_action_<piece>` splits the rest of the block action
    by piece of local work (ACTION_PIECES: the GEMMs, the Hadamard product,
    the Hartree term, the owner-order write, the batch's element-wise
    terms), so the work no rank count divides can be told from the work it
    does; zero for an action that does not time its pieces.
    `davidson_block_action_by_rank` (under a comm) lists every rank's action
    time, which is where load imbalance in the row split shows.
    `davidson_subspace_<piece>` splits `davidson_subspace` of the pair-row
    loop (SUBSPACE_PIECES: the tile arithmetic, the replicated small solves,
    the batch and result gathers, the small reductions, the checked
    locksteps), zero where real_eig runs whole, and `davidson_trial_space_mb`
    is what this rank's four holders take, 32 bytes per pair row per trial
    pair. `davidson_precond_setup` is the preconditioner's diagonal, zero
    for the bare one.

    refuse_unconverged: a root left above conv_tol raises rather than warns,
    on every rank, since every rank holds rank 0's `converged`.
