# Examples

Each file is self-contained and runnable: `python examples/01_adc3.py`.
All use H2O/cc-pVDZ unless noted, so the numbers are directly comparable
(`11_bse_davidson_vs_dense.py` is cc-pVTZ; `18_periodic_slab_gw.py` is a
periodic H2 slab).

| `17_spin_orbit_coupling.py` | <S1\|H_SO\|T1/T2> at both relaxed minima from `15`'s adiabatic gap (El-Sayed's rule), plus the Herzberg-Teller dV/dq scan over the ground-state modes that finds the promoting mode |
| `18_periodic_slab_gw.py` | the continuum of `13` for a periodic **slab** — electrolyte above, metal electrode below |
| `19_ee_adc.py` | electronic-excitation ADC(2)/ADC(3): spin-free, matrix-free, DF, and the singlet and triplet channels |
| `20_vibronic_band_shape.py` | formaldehyde S1: both minima, Huang-Rhys factors by the gradient and the displacement route, and the absorption and emission bands at 300 K with their FWHM (eV, cm^-1, nm) and Stokes shift (`band_shape`) |
| `21_ee_fold.py` | the folded EE solver: ADC(2), GF2 and the one-doubles-set BSE@GW of Monino and Loos (2023) solved root by root on the singles space, the folded ADC(2) roots beside the full solve |

The auxiliary basis is a choice, not a detail. `<basis>-ri` is an MP2
correlation-fitting set for occupied-virtual products, while J, K and the BSE
direct term contract `(ij|ab)` — occupied-occupied against virtual-virtual.
Fitting those in `-ri` puts 21 meV between DF and the exact tensor at cc-pVDZ
and 6 meV at cc-pVTZ, where `-jkfit` gives 2 meV. `11` therefore passes
`-jkfit`, and passes it to the separable fit as well: that side does not read
the mean field's auxiliary basis, and mismatching the two costs more than
either route's own error.

`09` and `10` still use `-ri`. They print no DF-against-exact comparison, so the
choice is invisible there, but it is the same trade. The library default stays
`<basis>-ri` because the shipped ISDF radii are keyed on the auxiliary basis and
`-jkfit` rows exist only for H and O at cc-pVDZ; changing the default would
silently drop every other configuration back to an unoptimized grid.

## Choosing a route

**Quasiparticle energies** → `calc_qp_energy(mf, state='homo')`: the Casida
route with density fitting, `polarizability='RPA'`, i.e. plain G0W0. `mode=`
swaps in the low-scaling routes (`'imagfrequency'`, `'space-time'`), both of
which require `df=True`; `df=False` gives the 4-center Casida reference. See
`10_gw_routes.py`.

**Excitation energies** → `solve_bse_isdf(mf, mol, nocc)`: a matrix-free
Davidson BSE on a separable (ISDF) factorization, `qp='G0W0'`, so it runs its
own GW and returns BSE@G0W0. It is ISDF whatever the mean field is; the dense
A/B route is the reference, not the production path. See
`11_bse_davidson_vs_dense.py`.

**Closed shell** → `ADCSolverRestricted` (spin-free). Add `B_aa=` for DF once the
dense ERI stops fitting. **Open shell** → `ADCSolver` (spin-orbital).

**EN** is ADC(3) only. Pass the same `u2_denom_dress` dict to both the solver and
the static correction — dressing one and not the other silently mixes methods.

- `spin_adapted=True` + `shift='sum'` (2J−K): production. `'mean'` (J−K/2) and
  `'opposite'` (J) are the other weightings.
- `singles=False` dresses the doubles only — the calibrated variant.
- `singles='screened'` replaces the bare CIS/BSE diagonal J−K by the
  RPA-screened J_W−K (restricted only): see `08_en_adc3_screened_singles.py`.

`ADCSolver.u2_denom_dress` raises: its U^(2) blocks are a merged form that is
only valid for the bare amplitude.

## Large systems

`09_isdf_gw_space_time.py` is the production route once the dense `cderi` stops
fitting: the SCF and the GW share ONE separable (ISDF) factorization, which is
both the cheaper choice and the correct one — pairing factors from one fit with
a screened interaction from another stays self-consistent and silently moves the
spectrum. Pass `freq_block=` or `scratch_dir=` to `solve_qp_energy_space_time`
when even the frequency-axis W does not fit; the answer is unchanged.

## Periodic slabs

`SlabDielectricEnvironment` + `build_dfintegrals_screened`
(`src/SingleReference/Periodic/pbc_solvent_screening.py`) are the periodic
counterpart of the PCM continuum in `13`. A 3D crystal has no outside, so there
is no cavity; a slab does — the environment fills the vacuum. The closed cavity
is replaced by an **image-charge boundary condition** at each planar interface,
which is exactly rank 2 per in-plane momentum, so it enters the RI-V metric as a
rank-2 update of `J(q)` and `B(q)`. Everything downstream reads only
`PBCDFIntegrals.L`, so screened RPA / W^Q / BSE / Σ_c all follow.
`eps_bot=np.inf` is a metal electrode; `eps_top=solvent` is the electrolyte.

Slab-specific requirements: a non-negative Coulomb kernel (use the damped
kernel from `pbc_rpa_damping` — pyscf's `get_coulG` is negative at G=0 for
`dimension < 3`, and `low_dim_ft_type='inf_vacuum'` breaks pyscf's own
periodic SCF), and a cavity that encloses the density
(`leaked_density_fraction`). The single in-plane channel at q∥+G∥ = 0 is
dropped — a mixed-representation head cannot be regularized against a
G-diagonal `coulG`; see the module docstring.
