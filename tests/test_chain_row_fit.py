"""The gradient chains on the row-distributed fit: `FrozenFactorization(
sliced=True, fit='rows')` builds each rank's grid rows of X_mo, D and X_ao
with `separable_ri.fit_rows` on the frozen points, so no rank forms the fit
whole at any geometry, and the rows are bitwise the same at every rank count.

Gated over 1, 2, 3 and 8 simulated ranks (`run_simulated`, threads of this
process with the real collectives) on water/cc-pVDZ Hartree-Fock at 148
points per atom, in tiles of `TILE` points so that the 444-point grid is cut
into 7 tiles and every rank count owns a different set of them, each rank on
its own Mole:

  (a) the rows every rank holds, at the reference and at a displaced
      geometry, are bitwise the same rows of a one-rank run of the chain;
  (b) THE ANCHORED GATE: against the whole-fit sliced chain at the SAME rank
      count, the composed state-pair force, energy and root at a displaced
      geometry, the BSE roots at the reference, the dRPA force and a
      one-cycle optimizer step sit within `FIT_REASSOCIATION_K` times the
      distance the whole-fit chain itself moves when the sums of its fit
      over the test set are cut per shell and accumulated in reverse -- a bar
      measured on the run;
  (c) THE MEMORY SCAN: at every evaluation the walk asks for, before it and
      right after each factor build inside it, no array reachable from the
      surface has the whole grid on one axis and a factor's or the fit's
      width on the other (X_mo, X_ao, D, M, F D^T, the Gram matrix), and
      every rows object is the row fit's own, its ledger naming every
      grid-indexed array of the fit at this rank's tiles; and at EVERY
      FORCE, the nuclear assembly traced line by line in every frame under
      src/ (`traced`): no array it names holds the grid by a factor's, the
      fit's or the test set's width (the Gram matrix, the test set's
      collocation, M, F D^T, a whole adjoint) beyond the X_bar and D_bar
      handed in, nor the dense (mu nu|P) where the fit's shell blocks cut
      the AO index, and the adjoint's own ledger (`adjoint_held`) names
      every grid-indexed array of the fit adjoint at this rank's tiles;
  (d) the whole-array gathers of one composed force are the whole-fit
      sliced chain's, {X_mo 7, D 8, X_o 3, X_v 2}, less the X_mo of its two
      nuclear assemblies, which stream X_mo by tiles on the row fit.

WATER CANNOT TELL THE TWO ESTIMATORS APART, which is why ethylene is here.
The row fit's Gram matrix is the unscreened product (A A^T) o (B B^T) and its
F D^T keeps the screened pairs; `FrozenFactorization._fit` screens both. At
water/cc-pVDZ the screen keeps every pair (576 of 576) and the two are one
estimator; at ethylene/cc-pVDZ it drops 72 of 2304 and they are 2.0e-4 of D
apart. So on ethylene the row-fit chain is gated against its own estimator
formed whole (every product pair in D, one Cholesky of the whole Gram
matrix) on that fit's own reassociation bar; its dRPA force against a
five-point finite difference of its own energy is gated in
tests/test_chain_row_fit_adjoint.py, beside the adjoint's own gates.

SHOWN TO FAIL, then restored and byte-compared (`cmp`): `row_fit_factors`
falling back to the whole fit -- `FrozenFactorization._fit` at the geometry,
D = M^T V^(1/2) formed whole and the rows cut from it
(`SlicedFactors.from_whole`) -- failed (c) at 2, 3 and 8 ranks on every scan
(rows without the fit's ledger), while (a), (b) and (d) stayed green: the
same rows and the same numbers, only formed whole.
