# Tests

Every file runs both as a script and under pytest. As a script it runs its
calculations, prints a verdict per check and exits non-zero if any of them
failed:

```bash
python tests/test_adc3.py
```

Read the exit code: a script that prints `FAILURES DETECTED` is telling you
something a green summary line would not. Under pytest, a file whose checks
take the molecule or mean field its `__main__` builds names them `check_*`,
moves the `__main__` body into `run()`, and has one argument-free `test_*`
that asserts `run()`; a `test_*` function never takes an argument no fixture
supplies and never returns its verdict. `test_conventions.py` fails on either,
and `conftest.py` makes pytest's warning about a returned value an error.

`test_imports.py` is the cheap one to run first: it imports every module under
`src/` in about a second and separates a missing `src.` module from a missing
optional third-party one.

`test_thc_metallic_frequency_grid`, `test_pbc_df_integrals`, `test_pbc_casida`
and `test_pbc_w` take seconds; the metal and slab tests take minutes.

## The ISDF and BSE tests, in the order they build on each other

These four are worth reading as a sequence, because each one guards a property
the next one assumes:

- `test_isdf_jk` — the J/K builder. Structure first (no three-index tensor is
  ever formed, `loop()` refuses), then accuracy against DF.
- `test_frame_sign_convention` — the interpolation grid is placed in per-atom
  frames whose axis SIGNS are pure gauge: negating one permutes grid rows and
  moves no point. Deterministic, continuous through planar geometries, and the
  energy invariant under every sign pattern.
- `test_grid_radii_optimizer` — the radii themselves, against Duchemin & Blase's
  published tables. The objective is multi-modal, so a single descent is a
  lottery; this pins that multi-start fixes it, that `n_start=1` still means the
  old single descent, and that recipes coexist in the shipped table.
- `test_static_exchange_routes` — the QP step's static exchange. `Sigma_x` built
  from the mean field's own K inherits the SCF route's error at first order, so
  this pins the streamed density-fitted build against the stored-tensor one and
  against the routing.

`test_bse_screening_energies` guards the other half of the same question: not
which basis W is expressed in, but which ENERGIES it is screened at. The BSE
diagonal carries the quasiparticle energies while W is screened at the
mean-field ones, and a 4-center solver has to be told that with `eps_screen=`
because it rebuilds the direct term itself. Getting it wrong is worth more than
the auxiliary basis error it looks like, and does not shrink under refinement.

`test_davidson_isdf_bse` is the gauge test of the pair: the matrix-free BSE
action against the dense Casida solver, plus the negative control of pairing
ISDF factors with a cderi-gauge `W_aux`, which stays self-consistent and gives
the wrong spectrum.

## The two tests that assert a FAILURE, and why

Both guard properties that nothing else in the suite would notice going away.

`test_evgw` drives the loop by hand with the quasiparticle equation anchored on
the ITERATE instead of the mean field, and asserts that it DIVERGES — the gap
opening by more than an eV every cycle. That version still runs and still
prints plausible numbers, so without the assertion, dropping `eps_anchor` would
leave every other check in the file passing.

`test_casida_normalization` hands `oscillator_strengths` a raw pySCF vector and
asserts it is refused by name. pySCF normalizes to ⟨X|X⟩ − ⟨Y|Y⟩ = 1/2 where
this repo uses 1, the difference cancels out of every excitation energy, and
the consumer is quadratic in the vector — so the mistake is a silent factor of
two in every oscillator strength with every root at the right energy.

## The environment seam

`test_environment` pins the rule the three solvent tests rest on: an
environment enters in two places and only one of them is a choice. Whether it
dresses the interaction is asked in exactly one place (`dresses_interaction`),
and the Eq. (18) quasiparticle shift follows from that answer rather than from
a switch of its own. The negative control is `PointCharges`, which does not
respond, therefore screens nothing, and must move the quasiparticle energy
through the mean field alone.

`test_reaction_field` then checks the economy that makes the shift affordable:
ΔW needs ONE χ₀, the bare screening following from the dressed one by a
congruence in the auxiliary gauge, and the compact contraction that never
builds ΔW must equal the explicit form that does.

## Reference data

`reference_data.json` and `adc_refactor_pins.json` hold pinned numbers several
tests compare against. Regenerating a pin is a deliberate act: it changes what
the suite considers correct, so the reason belongs in the commit that does it.

Optimized ISDF grid radii ship in `src/Base/data/optimized_radii.json`. The
per-machine scratch cache beside it (`src/Base/data/radii_cache/`) is
gitignored, because the radii optimizer is a numerically differentiated descent
under threaded BLAS and does not reproduce across thread counts — the shipped
table is what makes a clean clone reproduce the suite.

## The multi-rank tests

The MPI rows of the table above are pytest files that also run as scripts
(`python tests/test_kernel_lockstep.py`). They run every rank as a thread of
one process (`mpi_grid.run_simulated`), with the real collectives moving real
bytes, because MPI cannot initialize inside a sandboxed test runner; they gate
the algebra of every split, not the wire. Several compare against the code as
it stood before the port, extracted with `git archive` from a pinned commit
and run in its own process, so they need the repository's history.

`test_mpi_routes` is the wire check: every distributed route against its
serial reference, inside one `with distributed(comm):`, under real ranks:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -n 3 python tests/test_mpi_routes.py
```

Every rank's verdicts are gathered at the end and the script exits non-zero
if any check failed on any rank. Run serially it prints the serial references
and checks the one-rank paths; `run_simulated(main, n)` from
`tests/test_mpi_routes.py` runs the same checks over thread-ranks.

`test_elpa_casida` is the other script meant for several MPI ranks:

```bash
mpirun -n 4 python tests/test_elpa_casida.py
```

It solves the three Casida branches and ADC's dense matrix once with every rank
taking part and once with the workers parked in `serve_distributed_solves`, and
compares each with the serial solve. On more than one rank a cell that fell back
to `eigh` fails, so a missing `pyelpa` shows as a failure, not as a pass. Run
serially, as the suite does, it checks the comparisons only.
