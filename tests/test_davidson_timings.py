"""Where the ISDF BSE Davidson spends its wall clock, serially and under a comm.

The stage total says the Davidson is the largest term of a production BSE and
nothing about WHY a rank count stops helping it. `info['timings']` therefore
carries the loop broken up: the block action, its collectives included; the
part of it spent in those collectives (the entry lockstep of the trial
vectors, the head's gather, the reductions) plus the lockstep of the result,
`davidson_comm`; the subspace work, which every rank runs whole and no rank
count divides; the action's own build, which is paid once before the first
trial vector and shows in no per-iteration term; what the locksteps moved,
`davidson_lockstep_mb`, and what their digests proved every rank held
already, `davidson_lockstep_skipped_mb`; and the counts -- iterations, vectors
applied, largest subspace -- that say whether the cost is the action or the
number of times the guess made the solver call it.

The block action is split further, into its local pieces
(`davidson_action_<piece>`: the GEMMs, the Hadamard product, the Hartree
term, the owner-order write, the batch's element-wise terms), which with the
collectives inside it (`davidson_comm_gather`, `_reduce_grid`,
`_reduce_pairs`) say what of a vector's time a rank count divides. The
subspace work is split likewise where the trial space is cut by pair rows
(`davidson_subspace_<piece>`, zero serially), beside the bytes this rank's
holders take (`davidson_trial_space_mb`).

Gated here: the keys exist on every rank; the parts do not exceed the whole;
the counts are consistent with the `stats` the same run reports, so the two
cannot drift into two spellings of one number; every rank runs the same
iteration, so every rank reports rank 0's counts and lockstep volume and a
subspace of its own; and the whole dict survives `json.dumps`, so a caller
can record it as JSON.

The timers themselves move no bits: the same roots and vectors come back from
this code and from the uninstrumented one, bit for bit.

Water/cc-pVDZ Hartree-Fock, the setting every distributed test in this
directory uses (tests/test_simulated_ranks.py, tests/test_mpi_routes.py).

The `qp` stage carries the same kind of breakdown, from the space-time GW
solve `qp='G0W0'` (or `self_consistency='evGW'`) runs underneath: `qp_chi0`,
`qp_dyson`, `qp_sigma`, the exchange build `qp_static` and the per-state root
search `qp_states` (`GW/space_time.py`'s own `timings` dict, merged into `t`
by `_QPStageTimings`). Gated here beside the Davidson breakdown: the keys
exist serially and under a comm; the parts stay inside the `qp` stage they
came from; evGW's cycles SUM into those same keys rather than overwriting,
with `qp_cycles` saying how many; and the timers move no bits, checked against
the pre-instrumentation code itself, extracted with `git archive` and run in
its own process.

That last check is BITWISE and serial: the pre-instrumentation commit has no
communicator, so there is nothing to run under ranks there. Under a comm the
block action splits its head over the same grid rows as its exchange and
gathers it, and reduces the intermediate its tail contracts
(`isdf_block_action`), so a distributed run sums in rank order where a serial
one sums inside one GEMM; the distributed gates above therefore compare every
rank with rank 0, not with the archive.

Run as a script, this file hands itself to pytest and exits with its verdict.
