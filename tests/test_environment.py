"""The Environment seam: a chain sees ALL of an environment or none of it.

An environment enters in two places and only one of them is a choice.
`aux_kernel` dresses the interaction, v -> v + vtilde, and everything built
from the interaction then carries it -- W, the BSE kernel, and the Eq. (18)
self-polarization shift, which is the STATIC APPROXIMATION to
Sigma[W_dressed] - Sigma[W_bare] and therefore follows from `aux_kernel` alone
rather than from a second switch. `static_self_energy` is the other channel and
a different operator, for the routes that never form Delta W.

The gate is that `dresses_interaction` is the single place the first question
is asked, so a route reading `transform is not None` is reading that one
decision and not a rule of its own.

The last checks are the gradient side of the same contract: a screening
environment with no density-fitted or four-index form refuses those routes
rather than returning None, a cavity follows the atoms, a continuum carries
both halves of its nuclear derivative, and the dRPA ground-state force in a
fixed-charge field matches a five-point difference of the chain's own energy
(a minute or two, water/cc-pVDZ).
