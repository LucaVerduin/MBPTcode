"""Frequency grids that survive a metal.

Every imaginary-axis grid in Base/utils/grids.py is a T = 0 construction scaled
by the smallest transition energy -- the gap. For a metal there isn't one, and
the failures are silent. src/Base/utils/matsubara.py supplies the two things
that fixes: the thermal e_min that makes the existing quadratures well defined
again, and the intermediate representation, which has no gap in its
construction at all.

References: Shinaoka, Otsuki, Ohzeki, Yoshimi, PRB 96, 035147 (2017) for the
IR basis; Li, Wallerberger, Chikano, Yeh, Gull, Shinaoka, PRB 101, 035144
(2020) for sparse sampling -- Sec. II B for the tau points and Sec. II C for
the Matsubara points.

Checks:
  1. The T = 0 grids now REFUSE a vanishing, zero or inverted gap instead of
     returning a collapsed grid, negative frequencies and negative weights.
     This is the test that fails without the guard.
  2. thermal_e_min restores them: at finite temperature a metal gets a valid,
     strictly positive grid with positive weights.
  3. The IR basis is correct as a basis: u and v orthonormal, the kernel
     reconstructed to its truncation level, and the singular values decaying
     exponentially.
  4. Its size converges with the quadrature and grows like log(Lambda) -- the
     property that fails if the imaginary-time panels are refined toward the
     middle instead of toward tau = 0 and tau = beta.
  5. uhat matches the paper's parity rule: purely imaginary for even l, purely
     real for odd l.
  6. Fit-and-predict: sampling a Green's function at the sparse points and
     evaluating it OFF that set reproduces it to the basis tolerance -- for a
     gapped spectrum and, identically, for metallic ones with weight down to
     omega = 0. That equality is the whole point.
  7. Sampling counts are O(L) and the fit is well conditioned, with the
     real-coefficient stacking that the alternating real/imaginary columns of
     uhat require.
