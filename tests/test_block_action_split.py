"""Nothing in the ISDF block action is computed at full grid length per rank.

The row split of Zt divides the three M^2 n_occ passes, and for a while that
was all it divided: z X_v^T, the diagonal p of P, p D and the tail contraction
X_o^T (Zt * P) X_v ran WHOLE on every rank, an Amdahl floor the docstring of
`isdf_block_action` put at 15% of a four-rank action and the cluster measured
as 1.75x on two ranks where the split alone predicts 2x.

Each of the four now follows the rows, and each takes the collective its shape
asks for:

  z X_v^T   an output partition -- a rank builds the grid rows it owns and the
            ranks ALL-GATHER them (`mpi_grid.allgather_blocks`), because the
            exchange reads the whole grid index. Gathered, not summed: a row
            is computed once, by its owner.
  p, p D    a reduction -- p is per grid point, so a rank forms its own rows
            and contracts them with its own rows of D; naux doubles cross.
  the tail  a reduction -- X_o^T (Zt * P) is partial over the rows in its
            first index and whole in its second, so one reduce-scatter of
            (n_occ, M), laid out in owner order, hands each rank only its own
            columns, which it contracts with X_v.

Gated here, on water/cc-pVDZ and ethylene/cc-pVDZ Hartree-Fock (888 grid points
against water's 444, so the row blocks are not a handful of rows):

  * the SERIAL action is bitwise what it was, against the roots and vectors of
    the code before any rank split existed (`BASELINE_COMMIT`), unpacked into
    a temporary directory and run in its own process. Serially the whole split
    collapses -- the row block is the whole grid -- and every expression must
    be the one it replaces, character for character in the arithmetic if not
    in the source;
  * at 2 and 3 simulated ranks the roots sit within 1e-11 Ha of the serial
    ones, which is the standard the row split has always been held to (it
    re-associates the sums it reduces, so it is not bitwise), and every rank
    returns the same bits as every other and ran as many cycles: each runs the
    same iteration on the lockstepped action output;
  * every rank reports its own block-action count and time, and
    `davidson_block_action_by_rank` carries all of them, which is the number
    the cluster reads the scaling off;
  * the per-rank HEAD work, measured off the shapes of the GEMM the action
    actually runs, falls with the rank count and sums across the ranks to the
    serial head -- no grid point's head is paid twice;
  * one rank's own slice, perturbed by 1 + 1e-6 before it travels, MOVES the
    roots -- separately for the gathered z X_v^T, for the reduced tail and for
    the kernel rows this rank builds. A split whose pieces did not reach the
    answer would swallow the perturbation, and the gate fails if any does.

The SETUP takes the same treatment as the loop. This rank's rows of the
screened kernel are D_mine (W D^T) serially, where the inner product is naux^2
M multiply-adds and an (naux, M) array on every rank; under a rank count they
are (D_mine W) D^T, the same matrix from nmine naux^2 + nmine naux M and an
(nmine, naux) intermediate, both of which the rank count divides. The two
associations differ in their last bits, so the serial one stands as it was --
the bitwise gate above is what holds it there -- and the reassociated rows are
gated against it at the level double precision allows, 1e-13 relative, where
water and ethylene measure 1.5e-16 and 1.1e-15. The TDHF branch, D_mine D^T,
has no inner product to reassociate and is bitwise the same either way.
