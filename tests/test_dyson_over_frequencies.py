"""The space-time GW Dyson step, serially and split over frequencies under
simulated ranks.

`solve_qp_energy_space_time` turns chi0(i.omega) into W(i.omega) =
[I - chi0(i.omega)]^-1 one frequency at a time: the omega = 0 passenger, the
static W a BSE takes, inverted DRESSED, and in a continuum every other
frequency first taken into the bare gauge (`transform`). Gated on
water/cc-pVDZ and ethylene/cc-pVTZ Hartree-Fock and on water/cc-pVDZ in an
IEF-PCM water continuum, each on the GW window (no passenger in the gas
phase) and on the whole diagonal with the static W.

SERIALLY (`_dyson_in_place`) the energies and W(0) are bitwise those of the
code before the Dyson step was split over frequencies -- a pinned commit
unpacked into a temporary directory and run in its own process, on its own
constants, with the mean field and factors this process built and the
continuum's cavity handed to both (`CAVITY`) -- at the automatic tau count and
at 6 points; and one rank's `dyson_frequencies` is every frequency.

OVER MORE THAN ONE RANK the in-core route holds chi0 by auxiliary rows
(`_qp_grid_rows`). `_dyson_owned` gathers each frequency's chi0 whole to its
round-robin owner and inverts it there, W(0) is broadcast from its owner, and
`screened_interaction_rows` folds each owner's W - I into every rank's rows of
Wt(i.tau). None of that is summed across ranks, so every gate is bitwise. At
2, 3 and 8 simulated ranks, and at 8 on 6 tau points, where rank 7 owns no
frequency and rank 6 at most the passenger:
  * the frequencies the ranks invert cover every frequency exactly once, each
    on its round-robin owner, the passenger on the rank that broadcasts W(0);
    each rank's `dyson_frequencies` counts its own and `t_dyson` is set;
  * each owner's W - I is the serial Dyson step on the same chi0, gathered
    whole, bitwise -- the bare gauge included in the continuum;
  * W(0) is the serial step's dressed passenger, bitwise, on every rank and in
    what the driver hands a BSE;
  * every rank's rows of Wt(i.tau) are the rows of one rank's fold on that
    serial W - I, bitwise.
chi0 itself -- proj(tau) is a sum over the ranks' grid-row tiles, so it
re-associates -- and the energies against serial are gated in
tests/test_simulated_ranks.py, which also calls these kernels directly at 32
and 64 ranks.

Shown to fail, each planted at 3 ranks in the water diagonal (the last in the
continuum's window), failing exactly the gates named while the rest pass:
  a frequency inverted twice (rank 1 also takes      exactly once, round-robin
  frequency 0) -- no bit moves                       owner, the count
  the passenger inverted by no rank                  exactly once, round-robin
                                                     owner, the broadcasting
                                                     rank, W(0)
  W(0) not broadcast (the call made a no-op)         W(0)
  W(0) broadcast from the owner's successor          the broadcasting rank,
                                                     W(0)
  a Wt row from the wrong frequency (rank 1 hands    Wt rows
  the fold two of its W - I swapped)
  one owner's W - I moved by `PERTURBATION`          W - I, Wt rows
  the bare gauge dropped (the step handed no         W - I, Wt rows
  transform)
A screened frequency inverted by no rank cannot reach a gate: the fold on its
owner refuses it (KeyError), which is checked as well. Serially, a Dyson step
that takes the passenger into the bare gauge too moves the continuum's W(0)
by 8.4e-3 and its diagonal by 5.9e-3 Ha off the archived code.
