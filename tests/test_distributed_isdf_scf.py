"""The ISDF-K SCF over simulated ranks (`Base.distributed_isdf_jk`) against
the serial ISDFJK SCF, and the rules its handle is written to.

Gated, cc-pVDZ at 148 points per atom, tiles of `TILE` points so that every
rank count owns a different set of them (water 7 tiles, ethylene 14):
  * one rank and no region is the serial ISDFJK SCF itself: the factory
    hands back None and `distributed_mean_field` is `mf.kernel()`, bitwise;
  * at 2, 3 and 8 ranks, water and ethylene, PBE0 and LRC-wPBEh: the
    converged energy within the SCF's own `CONV_TOL` of the serial ISDF-K
    energy and the same on every rank, the orbitals one set of bits across
    the ranks, the mean field's own ISDFJK back on it afterwards;
  * J, K and the long-range K of one fixed density at 2, 3 and 8 ranks
    against the one-rank handle (the same tiles, no collective): K and K_lr,
    sums over row tiles, with every rank's partial its tiles' one-rank
    addends added in tile order, bitwise, and the reduced K within the
    rounding bound of the addends' exact sum at every element
    (`rounding_bound`: half an ulp of each partial sum a rank forms and of
    each join of two ranks' partials, the most any order of the reduction
    can move it, floored at one ulp of |K|max); J within COMPOSED_GRAD_K
    times the ranks' partials reversed, floored at one ulp of its largest
    element;
  * tests/test_distributed_isdf_scf_mpi.py's own checks at 8 ranks, where
    rank 7 owns none of water's 7 tiles: a pass on every rank;
  * the bytes every rank holds, read off the handle (`memory_faults` of
    tests/test_distributed_isdf_scf_mpi.py): its
    tiles of X and M^T and its rows of each operator's Z are its own tiles'
    rows and they tile the grid; nothing grid-indexed is whole -- not X, M^T,
    Z or X Dm X^T (one (tile, tile) block), T (the rank's rows), a streamed
    tile, a slab of the metric -- and neither is any array of the fit;
  * on a BLAS whose GEMM bits follow the call's shape AND the thread count
    of the calling rank's BLAS pool (a subprocess: every GEMM under src on
    the shape-sensitive stand-in of tests/test_force_serial_shaped.py, its
    scaling keyed on the pool too, and `Base.utils.threads` reading and
    limiting each simulated rank's own pool of `NODE_THREADS` threads
    (`on_the_node_pool`), so `blas_single_threaded` drops it to one and
    `blas_full_pool` gives it back as on a rank of a real node): every
    rank's tiles of Z (and of G, factored) bitwise the one-rank tiles, J on
    its anchored bar and K on its rounding bound; each rank's K partials
    built inside the SCF's wrap bitwise the ones outside it; after a
    distributed SCF whose handle was built inside it (`build=False`), every
    rank's tiles bitwise the one-rank tiles and its record at NODE_THREADS
    for the fit, the interaction and K -- while a GEMM over a rank's
    concatenated
    rows, a GEMM inside the wrap and a one-rank reference fitted at one
    pool thread, all three shown moved, would not be;
  * under the same emulated node in this process, the pool every stage of
    that SCF runs on: the fit's Cholesky, G and Z's rows, the K builds and
    the DF-J metric's factor and solve at NODE_THREADS, and `nr_rks`, the
    DF-J passes, the fit's three-centre integrals and the metric slabs at
    one; the density-fitted SCF's K and `nr_rks` at one, as before;
  * under the pyscf race (`racing_dgemm` of tests/test_force_serial_shaped.py,
    shown live on each run): every rank's converged energy and orbitals are
    rank 0's;
  * anthracene/cc-pVDZ/PBE0 at 3 ranks on the default tile, once.

SHOWN TO FAIL, the pooled gate: with `distributed_isdf_jk` building the
handle inside `blas_single_threaded` (the factory before this gate), every
rank fitted its tiles at one pool thread and the one-rank handle at the
process's own count, and at 2, 3 and 8 ranks every tile of both operators' Z
differed from the one-rank tile, K at 7.1e3 and K_lr at 5.2e4 to 6.1e4
times its rounding bound (0.2-0.7 without the defect) -- what 16-thread
OpenBLAS nodes showed, and what no workstation
gate could: the real `blas_single_threaded` is a no-op below
BLAS_WRAP_MIN_THREADS (two threads here) and off the main thread (every
simulated rank). On the shape stand-in alone, the pool left out, the same
code passed: no GEMM of the handle or of the row fit is rank-shaped. With
`blas_full_pool` a no-op (the handle's stages inside the SCF's wrap at one
thread, as they ran on the 8-node pentacene run), the pooled gate fails on
every rank's wrapped K partials and on every tile of the SCF-built handles,
and the per-stage test reads one thread for every GEMM stage. The script's
checks at 8 ranks, with the check of the SCF-built handle asking every rank
for a tile: rank 7 failed it for both functionals, as on the 8-node run.
