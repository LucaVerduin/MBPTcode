"""The BSE Davidson runs on every rank alike; MPI lives inside the block action.

`isdf_block_action` locksteps its trial vectors at entry (`mpi_grid.lockstep`:
rank 0's batch written into every rank's, in place) and gathers or all-reduces
every term it returns, so its output is the same on every rank by
construction. `_run_davidson` and the (A-B) probe therefore run replicated,
with no protocol between the ranks, and the converged roots and vectors are
lockstepped once at the end.

Gated here, on water/cc-pVDZ BSE@HF at 2, 3 and 8 simulated ranks:

  * every rank returns rank 0's roots, vectors and probe value bitwise, and ran
    the same iteration: the same cycle and probe matvec counts and the same
    lockstep volume, all of it proven equal by the checked locksteps' digests
    and none of it broadcast. Every distributed solve here holds its trial
    space on SPLIT_TILE tiles of pair rows (`trial_space.real_eig_rows`),
    whose reduced sums re-associate with the rank count, so no distributed
    root is pinned bitwise. Against the SERIAL roots they sit within
    ROOT_TOL, not on them: the row split re-associates the sums it reduces;
  * within what the Davidson resolves of the one-rank roots
    (`roots_resolution`, 1.1e-11 of |roots| here; measured 1.0e-13, 9.1e-14
    and 8.2e-14 at 2, 3 and 8 ranks) after the one-rank iteration, trial
    vector for trial vector; and the grid reduce-scatter
    (`reduce_scatter_rows`) handing every rank the rows one off its block
    breaks the action so far that the Davidson refuses the solve;
  * a trial vector perturbed by one ulp on the last rank changes nothing
    anywhere, bitwise, and `lockstep_stats` under `audit=True` counts exactly
    that one repair on exactly that rank -- the block action handed the
    perturbed batch directly, and a whole solve with the perturbation planted
    in the driver's own buffer in one iteration;
  * the probe's Lanczos, which replaces ARPACK over ranks (eigsh holds one
    process-wide lock across its whole iteration, matvecs included, so rank
    threads cannot all be inside it), meets dense eigenvalues through thick
    restarts, a degenerate lowest one included, and ARPACK's value and sign
    certificate on the BSE;
  * kernels called with no comm inside a `distributed` region follow it, and
    the DF route, whose action is not divided, runs whole on every rank:
    `solve_bse_df` in a region at 2 and 3 ranks returns rank 0's roots and
    vectors bitwise on every rank, within the Davidson's resolution of the
    serial ones (its action re-associates nothing, its trial space does),
    and a one-ulp perturbation of rank 1's batch is repaired at the action's
    entry.

Removing the entry lockstep of `isdf_block_action` fails both ISDF
perturbation gates (the action's output then differs on the perturbed rank,
and the planted ulp moves the returned roots), and removing that of
`df_block_action` fails the DF one on its audited repair, which is what makes
them gates.
