"""Surfaces evaluate identically on every rank under the distribution context.

A surface carries no communicator: inside `with distributed(comm):` every rank
builds it and evaluates it whole, the kernels it reaches divide their sweeps
over the ranks, and `surface.evaluate` -- the boundary a property routine
hands a geometry across -- locks the geometry to rank 0's on the way in and the
energy, force and diagnostics on the way out. Six gates:

  (a) SERIALLY every surface is what it was before any of this existed:
      `tests/baseline_3f09ac0.json`, recorded before these classes ever took
      a communicator, bitwise -- `==` on the energy, `np.array_equal` on the
      gradient taken through `evaluate` -- and none of them carries a `comm`.
      A single-machine gate by design: the numbers were recorded by a pyscf without
      OpenMP, which repeats its bits, and a threaded pyscf adds its K-split
      partials in thread-arrival order and cannot meet them.
  (b) Under `run_simulated` (sizes 2 and 3; `run_simulated` enters the
      context on each rank-thread) the composed and single-chain surfaces
      reproduce the SAME surface evaluated serially, and every rank returns
      the same bits. Every rank converges its own SCF, so the comparison
      spans two SCF runs and its bar is anchored: `COMPOSED_GRAD_K` times
      what the serial surface's energy and force move when it is evaluated
      again on one BLAS thread (`one_thread`), at least a floor -- 1e-12 Ha
      for the energy, the ISDF gradient reproducibility floor for the force
      of one chain's sweeps, and `COMPOSED_GRAD_FLOOR`
      (tests/test_mpi_routes.py) for RPABSESurface, which combines TWO
      chains' distributed sweeps (the ground state's frequency loop and the
      excited state's tau/frequency/Davidson ones). MEASURED (max abs force
      in Ha/Bohr; every rank's energy bitwise the serial one; size 8 run
      outside the suite):
                           one-thread repeat   size=2     size=3     size=8
          RPAGroundStateChain      3.786e-09  2.698e-09  3.068e-09  1.626e-09
          RPABSESurface            1.652e-08  1.421e-08  6.265e-09  1.414e-08
          RPAQPSurface             6.593e-09  2.674e-09  1.822e-09  3.287e-09
      the one-thread repeat moving the energies 1.4e-14, 4.7e-13 and
      2.8e-14 Ha.
  (c) `potential_energy_surface` inside the context builds the same surface
      a direct constructor does, bitwise, and refuses a `comm=` keyword by
      name: a communicator handed to a surface would be a second way to the
      ranks, disagreeing with the context the moment the two differ.
  (d) THE GEOMETRY LOCKSTEP. Rank 1's geometry is moved by one ulp before an
      evaluation, which is what an optimizer whose arithmetic drifted on one
      node would hand the surface. Every rank still returns the unperturbed
      energy and force, bitwise; rank 1's Mole ends holding rank 0's
      coordinates; and an audited run counts exactly ONE repaired lockstep on
      rank 1 -- the geometry, by the ulp itself -- and nothing downstream,
      because every kernel then sees rank 0's molecule. Run on a factory that
      converges its own SCF and on a build-only one, whose SCF the ranks
      converge together (`converged_factory`). SHOWN TO FAIL with the geometry
      lockstep removed from `evaluate` (2 ranks), on both: rank 1 evaluates
      its own molecule, its Mole keeps the perturbed coordinate, and the
      audit counts 7 of 15 locksteps repaired on rank 1 with the
      self-converging factory and 77 of 91 with the build-only one, the
      largest difference 2.7e-3 either way -- the mean field of another
      molecule. With the self-converging factory the force is nonetheless
      bitwise the unperturbed one: each rank converges its own SCF, and the
      mean field, the placed points, the fit, the chain's own share and the
      result are each locked further down, so rank 1's molecule reaches no
      reduction. With the build-only factory it does -- rank 1's J/K
      partials of its own molecule enter the distributed SCF -- and the force
      is 8.7e-9 Ha/Bohr away from the unperturbed one on EVERY rank, rank 0
      included.
  (e) THE CHAIN'S OWN SHARE OF THE GRADIENT. The orbital response, the
      collocation and the fit branch a chain forms from the kernels' adjoints
      are serial code on every rank, and across nodes they carry each node's
      last bits; `nuclear_gradient` ends in one lockstep. Rank 1's orbital
      branch is moved by 1e-12 Ha/Bohr here, and every rank must return rank
      0's gradient bitwise. SHOWN TO FAIL with that lockstep removed: rank 1
      returns its own, 1e-12 away. That gradient is the serial one within the
      routes test's anchored bar: `COMPOSED_GRAD_K` times what the serial
      force moves on one BLAS thread (`one_thread_scatter`), at least
      `COMPOSED_GRAD_FLOOR`, since the partition re-associates the sums the
      orbital response amplifies.
  (f) THE MEAN FIELD A CHAIN OR SURFACE ACCEPTS. A mean field each rank
      converged alone differs across nodes by its last bits and by the gauge
      of its orbitals, so every place the physics layer takes one in locks it
      to rank 0's: a chain's `mf=`, the one `mean_field` is handed at another
      geometry, the entry point's reference and the mean-field surface's own.
      Rank 1's copy is given its lowest orbital energy one ulp up and its
      last orbital's sign flipped -- another node's SCF, in miniature -- and
      every rank must end holding rank 0's arrays. SHOWN TO FAIL with each of
      the four `lockstep_mean_field` calls removed in turn: rank 1 keeps its
      own orbitals, at that entry and no other.

ONE MOLE PER RANK wherever two rank threads differentiate, for the reason
`tests/test_simulated_ranks.py` documents at length: the nuclear gradient's
Hcore derivative writes into `mol._env` in place (`mol.with_rinv_at_nucleus`),
and two rank THREADS of one process sharing a Mole corrupt each other's rinv
origin.
