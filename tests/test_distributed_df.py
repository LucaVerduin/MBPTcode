"""The distributed Fock build reproduces the serial mean field, and divides
the fitted tensor and the quadrature grid.

`mpi_grid.simulated_world` runs each rank in a thread of this process and
broadcasts and reduces through shared memory, so the whole sequence runs here
-- pyscf's SCF on every rank, the density and its orbitals locked at every J/K
build and every quadrature, the reductions of (J, K) and of (nelec, E_xc,
V_xc), the loop's exit settings and the converged mean field locked -- where
MPI itself cannot start. What it does not test is the wire protocol.

Two and three ranks: 116 and 278 auxiliary functions divide evenly by neither,
so both gates carry a rank whose block is one row short, and the slices have to
tile their index rather than merely cover it.

WHAT IS BITWISE AND WHAT IS NOT. The rows a rank builds are, against the same
column blocks walked by one rank: the metric factor is rank 0's, replicated,
every AO-pair column is evaluated by exactly one rank and travels verbatim, so
the slices reassemble with no difference at all -- that is
`test_slices_tile_the_auxiliary_index`, and it is what says the split is of
ONE tensor. Against pyscf's DEFAULT blocking they differ by the last bit of
the smallest elements, which is a property of how many columns go into one
`solve_triangular` and not of the split: pyscf's own builder differs from
itself by the same 2.5e-17 between two `max_memory` settings. The grid points
are bitwise outright: they are rank 0's own, broadcast and sliced, so the
weights a rank integrates concatenate back to rank 0's grid bit for bit. What
the ranks REDUCE is not: the sums over the auxiliary index and
over the grid points are re-associated at the rank boundaries, so the Fock
matrix moves in its last bits and the SCF stops at a mean field that differs by
the convergence tolerance. Every rank takes every decision -- DIIS, the
occupation, when it has converged -- from rank 0's density and orbitals,
locked into its own arrays at every Fock piece, and the grid is rank 0's, so
the ranks cannot diverge further than that, and after the final lockstep they
hold the same orbitals bit for bit. Without a communicator, or on a world of
one, nothing here runs at all and the mean field is pyscf's own, bit for bit
(`test_one_rank_world_is_pyscf`).

WHAT SPANS TWO SCF RUNS. A distributed mean field against the serial one is
two SCF runs, and a threaded pyscf, whose OpenMP GEMM adds its K-split
partials in thread-arrival order, does not repeat one bit for bit. Those
comparisons are gated on an anchored bar (`scf_bars`): `COMPOSED_GRAD_K`
times what running the serial SCF again moves the energy, the density and the
orbital energies, one ulp at the least, floored at `E_TOL`, `DM_TOL` and
`MO_TOL`; where two distributed runs of one layout are compared, within
`COMPOSED_GRAD_K` times the repeat alone, which is bitwise here, where pyscf
repeats its bits. The checks that the serial path IS pyscf's own SCF, and the
subprocess probe against the archived tree, are `==` on two runs:
single-machine gates by design, met where pyscf repeats its bits.

EVERY GATE HERE WAS SHOWN TO FAIL:

  what is broken                         what then fails
  one rank's partial K scaled by         the energy gate, 2.2e-8 Ha out
  1 + 1e-6                               against a tolerance of 1e-10
  one rank's partial V_xc scaled by      the DENSITY gate, 2.2e-7 out, and the
  1 + 1e-6                               orbital energies, 1.9e-7 Ha -- not the
                                         energy, which is stationary in the
                                         density and reads E_xc, not V_xc
  one rank's partial E_xc scaled by      the energy gate, 3.0e-6 Ha out
  1 + 1e-6
  the reduction of J and K made a        every gate: each rank iterates on its
  no-op (the collective still called)    own rows' J and K, the ranks stop at
                                         different cycles and the next
                                         lockstep refuses on every rank
  the reduction of the quadrature made   every gate: the ranks fall out of step
  a no-op                                the same way and the run raises
  the row split made a no-op, every      the tiling gate on the blocks and on
  rank keeping the whole tensor          the bytes, and the energy by 28 Ha
  the point split made a no-op, every    the tiling gate on the point counts,
  rank integrating the whole grid        and the PBE0 energy by 7.2 Ha
  one AO-pair column block skipped by    the reassembly gate, and the energy
  the rank that owns it                  by 47.3 Ha with the SCF still
                                         reporting itself converged
  the density's lockstep taken out of    the repair gate: rank 1 keeps the
  `get_jk`, rank 1's density moved one   density it was handed, its DIIS
  ulp before one J/K build               extrapolates another Fock matrix from
                                         the next cycle on, and the audit
                                         counts no repair
  rank 1 given conv_tol 1e-2 and         nothing -- which is the point:
  max_cycle 1                            `test_worker_takes_no_decision` says
                                         the exit is rank 0's; with the exit
                                         settings' lockstep taken out, rank 1
                                         stops early and the next lockstep
                                         refuses on every rank
  the refusal of a with_df that is       the with_df gate: both ranks converge a
  neither pyscf's DF nor ISDF's          foreign with_df mean field on plain
  taken out                              density-fitted rows and report nothing

THE TIMERS read the clock at stage boundaries and are gated the way every
other instrumented route in this repo is: every key present on every rank,
the stages inside the total, the cycle count pyscf's own, and the dict
JSON-clean for a caller that records it.
