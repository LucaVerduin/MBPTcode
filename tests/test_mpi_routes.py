"""Every distributed route must reproduce the serial answer, under real ranks.

    python tests/test_mpi_routes.py              # serial references only
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -n 2 python tests/test_mpi_routes.py   # the check

Script, not a pytest module: it initializes MPI, which a sandboxed test runner
cannot, and it exits with a status; pytest collects nothing from it. With
MBPT_USE_MPI=0 the script runs serially even where mpi4py is installed.
`main(comm)` takes the communicator, so `run_simulated(main, n)` runs the same
checks over thread-ranks where MPI cannot start.

THE RUN IS ONE DISTRIBUTED REGION. `main` enters `with distributed(comm):`
once, as a job script does, and every rank runs every driver replicated -- the
SCF loop, the Davidson, the chains; MPI lives inside the kernels, which
lockstep at entry what can differ between ranks and all-reduce or gather their
partials. A kernel called without `comm=` inside the region takes the region's
communicator (the CONTEXT path, which is what a chain or a driver reaches); one
called with `comm=comm` takes it explicitly (the EXPLICIT path, the kernel's
own entry). Both are gated, each check says which it covers, and the serial
reference beside it is computed on every rank inside `distributed(None)`. An
exception on any rank aborts the job through the region's guard instead of
leaving the others waiting in a collective.

THE INPUTS ARE ONE CALCULATION'S. The factors are built inside the region, so
their points, the mean-field arrays they read and the fit's replicated tail are
rank 0's on every rank; every kernel below takes those inputs, identical by
construction, and a serial reference on rank r is of the same numbers as rank
0's. The chain gates compare against rank 0's serial force, since each rank
converges the chain's SCF on its own.

FOUR STANDARDS, each where the design puts it:
  bitwise   a lockstepped output, or an output partition (rows computed once
            and gathered verbatim): identical on every rank, and identical to
            serial where the only reductions add exact zeros
  reduced   a sum re-associated over the partition: a bar at the summation
            order (1e-12 or 1e-11 relative, 1e-10 Ha, 1e-9 eV), `SIGMA_REL`
            for the cancelling Wt(tau) sum
  bounded   a sum reduced over the ranks from the serial kernel's own
            addends: every rank's partial its addends in the kernel's order,
            bitwise, and the reduced sum within the rounding bound of the
            partials' exact sum, the most any reduction tree can move it
            (tests/reduction_bounds.py)
  anchored  a bar measured on this run: `COMPOSED_GRAD_K` times the one-thread
            repeat of the serial force, `SOP_ANCHOR_K` times the pole model's
            own ulp response. Also wherever two evaluations each ran pyscf's
            own threaded work: its OpenMP GEMM (`lib.ddot`) splits K over the
            threads and adds the partials in thread-arrival order, so at 16
            threads no pyscf result repeats bit for bit, and two SCF runs, or
            two chains' K builds on one mean field, are never bitwise

Checks (path; standard):
  * SCF, RHF and PBE0, `distributed_mean_field`: split_grid=True (context),
    split_grid=False (explicit): e_tot and density against serial (anchored:
    `COMPOSED_GRAD_K` times what running the serial SCF again moves them, one
    ulp at the least, and at least the reduced 1e-10 Ha and 1e-8, since two
    SCF runs are compared), mo_coeff across ranks (bitwise), the cderi slices
    tile naux (exact), PBE0 split_grid True against False (anchored, the same
    energy bar)
  * the fixture's factors, `separable_factors` in the region (context):
    identical on every rank (bitwise)
  * the space-time GW window's low-memory path: `freq_block` (context),
    `scratch_dir` (explicit): against in-core (reduced)
  * static W, `isdf_bse_factors` (context): against serial (reduced)
  * the ISDF BSE, `solve_bse_isdf` (context): roots, (A-B) probe and GW
    diagonal against serial (reduced); every rank holds rank 0's roots
    (bitwise) after the same Davidson -- `davidson_vind_calls` and
    `davidson_iterations` equal to rank 0's (exact)
  * the same BSE with rank != 0 handed a perturbed spectrum and perturbed
    factors (explicit): roots against serial (reduced), the perturbation
    overwritten with rank 0's arrays (bitwise), rank 0's roots and Davidson on
    every rank (bitwise, exact)
  * the BSE block action's grid reduction (explicit), recorded on the
    communicator it is handed: per trial vector one reduce-scatter of the
    (n_occ, M) partial X_o^T (Zt * P), each rank receiving its
    `contiguous_block` rows alone and the ranks' rows tiling the grid once,
    no all-reduce as long as that intermediate, and A and B the bits of the
    same action on the unrecorded communicator (exact, bitwise)
  * the factors held as grid-point slices, `separable_factors(sliced=True)`
    (context): each rank's rows of the fixture and nothing more (bitwise,
    exact); the GW window (explicit) and the BSE (context) on them against
    the fixture's factors (bitwise), rank 0's Davidson on every rank, and
    each whole-array gather once per solve or sweep (exact)
  * the in-core GW window split over grid rows (`_qp_grid_rows`), on sliced
    factors at tiles and blocks small enough that the ranks share a tau
    point's tiles and block pairs (explicit): traced line by line in every
    frame between the solve and the running line, no array whole along the
    grid twice (an (M, M) block), no whole stack of (naux, naux) slices and
    no (n, nao, nao) AO self-energy, and no more whole (naux, naux) slices
    at once than the rank's own frequencies and `ROW_SPARE_SLICES` (exact);
    the same trace with a whole Pi(tau) slice planted in the sweep finds it
    on every rank (exact, shown failing); the window against serial
    (anchored: `COMPOSED_GRAD_K` times what relabelling the grid points moves
    it serially, floored at the root finder's `QP_BISECTION_TOL`), the window
    and W(0) rank 0's on every rank (bitwise)
  * the route's two reduced sums on this run's ranks (explicit, recorded on
    the communicator): proj(tau) over the grid-row tiles and the branch sums
    of Sigma over the block pairs, each against the serial kernel's own
    addends -- in its order they are its result (bitwise), this rank's
    partial of every tau point is its own items' addends in that order
    (bitwise), and what it receives lies within `join_bound` of the exact
    sum of the ranks' partials, half an ulp per join, floored at one ulp of
    the sum's largest element (bounded: the most any reduction tree can
    move it, tests/reduction_bounds.py); chi0's rows the update of the
    received proj rows, W(0) the inversion of their chi0(0) and the route's
    W(0) that one (bitwise)
  * `qp_set_gradient` (explicit): roots against serial (bitwise), adjoints
    (reduced)
  * `rpa_energy_and_adjoint` (context): energy and adjoints (reduced)
  * `qp_gradient_space_time`: contour deformation (context) root, Z and
    adjoints (reduced); pole model (explicit) (anchored)
  * `static_screening` (explicit) (reduced); `screened_interaction_tau`,
    `selfenergy_diag` and its backward pass (context), `selfenergy_block` and
    its backward pass (explicit) (reduced, `SIGMA_REL`)
  * the BSE@GW chain, `ExcitedStateChain` in the region (context): ONE grid on
    every rank (bitwise hashes), the excitation force (anchored), the
    quasiparticle force (anchored, at least `ISDF_GRADIENT_FLOOR`)
  * the chain with a build-only factory (context: the chain converges its SCF
    through `distributed_mean_field` on the region's ranks): orbitals across
    ranks (bitwise), mf0 against the self-converged one (reduced) and a
    stationary point of the serial SCF to its own conv_tol_grad, its force
    against the serial force off that same mean field (anchored); at one
    rank, where that is `mf.kernel()`, ONE plain run of it on the mean field
    the factory built, no distributed handles left on it, and the chain
    holding that run's energy and orbitals (bitwise)
  * the state-pair surface on sliced factors, `RPABSESurface(sliced=True)`
    (context), both layouts handed ONE reference and ONE displaced mean
    field: its composed force, energy and root at a displaced geometry
    against the whole layout's on the same ranks (anchored: `COMPOSED_GRAD_K`
    times the largest difference between `SLICED_SAMPLES` evaluations of one
    layout on those mean fields, the force at the excitation force's gate at
    the least, since each layout's chains still run pyscf's K builds and the
    mean field's force for themselves), every rank rank 0's (bitwise); the
    factorization holding this rank's rows and no whole fit, and each
    whole-array gather once per sweep or solve (exact). The layout itself is
    bitwise on one mean field where pyscf repeats its bits, which
    tests/test_force_serial_shaped.py shows on a shape-sensitive BLAS
  * the same surface on the row-distributed fit, `fit='rows'` (context),
    every surface on the same reference and displaced mean field: its
    composed force against the whole-fit sliced surface on the same ranks
    (anchored: `FIT_REASSOCIATION_K` times what one reassociation of the
    whole fit's sums moves that force), every rank rank 0's (bitwise), and
    nothing reachable from it holding the grid whole beside a factor's or
    the fit's width, its rows the row fit's own at this rank's tiles
    (exact); the row fit's own adjoint in the nuclear assembly against the
    whole adjoint of the same estimator (anchored: `FIT_REASSOCIATION_K`
    times what reordering the whole adjoint's sums over the test set moves
    the force), and each assembly traced line by line in every frame under
    src/: no array of the grid by a factor's, the fit's or the test set's
    width beyond the X_bar and D_bar handed in, and the adjoint's ledger at
    this rank's tiles, the metric root on rank 0 alone (exact)
  * the state-pair surface on sliced factors with the grid BSE adjoint,
    `bse_adjoint='grid'`, and with the default one (context), both handed ONE
    reference and ONE displaced mean field with pyscf's OpenMP on one thread,
    each route gated over the ranks against its own serial kernel and never
    against the other: the two surfaces' energy and root (bitwise: one
    forward pass, the adjoint is all that differs); at the reverse call the
    grid adjoint's four Casida-level seeds, computed over the ranks, the bits
    of the same kernel run serially on the gathered factors, and the composed
    force the bits of the same fold of those serial seeds on the same pieces,
    every rank's rank 0's (bitwise); the default adjoint's seeds the bits of
    `bse_cache` and `bse_backward` run serially on the gathered factors, its
    force every rank's rank 0's (bitwise); no three-index block reachable
    from the chain or its forward pass at the reverse call, where the default
    route's cache is found (exact); the grid kernel traced line by line in
    every frame it enters: no array with the whole grid on an axis outside
    the one named boundary gather of X_bar and D_bar
    (`adjoints_at_the_boundary`), no whole-factor gather (exact). The two
    routes' forces are printed beside each other, not gated: their seeds
    agree to a few ulp, the fold's exact image of the difference is 1e-16
    Ha/Bohr, and what the computed forces differ by is the fold's own
    rounding, a fit adjoint of Gram condition 2e8 carrying last-bit input
    changes to 1e-8 Ha/Bohr; the routes' identity is gated serially, on the
    seeds, at a derived rounding bound (tests/test_bse_grid_adjoint.py)
  * the lockstep counters of the whole run: calls and bytes identical on every
    rank (exact; `lockstep` is a collective)
  * ONE audited chain forward, `distributed(comm, audit=True)`, on a mean field
    each rank converged alone: no `agreement` found the ranks apart, and the
    audit ran; `mismatched_calls` and `max_abs_diff` report the cross-rank
    drift the locksteps absorbed
