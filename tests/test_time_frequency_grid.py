"""TimeFrequencyGrid: one container, two backends, and the honest diagnostics.

Checks:
  1. The ported minimax cosine transform reproduces the model pair it is fitted
     for: Pi(i.tau) = e^{-x tau}  ->  Pi(i.omega) = 2x/(x^2 + omega^2).
  2. The minimax forward/backward pair is NOT a dual -- the property that makes
     four separate matrices necessary rather than one plus an inverse.
  3. The IR backend, by contrast, DOES round-trip, because its transform goes
     through basis coefficients.
  4. gauss_legendre carries a frequency axis only and refuses to transform
     rather than returning nonsense.
  5. Both backends present the identical interface, so a consumer never
     branches on `method`.
  6. The transform fit is a pseudo-inverse: an exactly zero singular value
     contributes zero instead of 0/0, every other one is inverted bitwise as
     before, and a row that still comes out non-finite is refused.
  7. A grid size is an explicit count or the 'auto' sentinel resolved by the
     widest range, never a sentinel forwarded into a constructor.

Usage: python tests/test_time_frequency_grid.py; every check also asserts, so
the functions are pytest-collectable and fail there as well.
