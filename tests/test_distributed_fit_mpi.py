"""The row-distributed ISDF fit under real ranks.

    python tests/test_distributed_fit_mpi.py                 # one rank
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -n 3 python tests/test_distributed_fit_mpi.py

Script, not a pytest module: it initializes MPI, which the sandboxed test
runner cannot, and it exits with a status. `main(comm)` takes the
communicator, so `run_simulated(main, n)` runs the same checks over
thread-ranks where MPI cannot start; tests/test_distributed_fit.py gates the
same properties in pytest over simulated ranks.

THE RUN IS ONE DISTRIBUTED REGION, as in tests/test_mpi_routes.py: the row
fit, `separable_factors(fit='rows')`, runs inside `with distributed(comm):`
and writes rank 0's orbitals and points into every rank's inputs; the serial
references are computed on every rank afterwards inside `distributed(None)`,
on those inputs. Each check says whether the fit or the consumer took the
region's communicator ([context]) or was handed it ([explicit]), and every
rank's verdict is gathered: a check that fails on rank 2 fails the run.

Checks, water/cc-pVDZ Hartree-Fock, tiles of `TILE` points (7 tiles):
  * rows only [context]: the factors a rank holds are its `contiguous_block`
    rows, and every grid-indexed array the fit held (`fit_held`) is its own
    tiles' or rows' size, below the whole
  * bitwise across the ranks' views [context]: every rank's rows of X_mo, D
    and X_ao are the same rows of a one-rank run of the row fit on the same
    points, at `TILE` and at `FIT_CHOLESKY_BLOCK`
  * the anchored gate [context]: D over all ranks' rows against the serial
    replicated fit, within `FIT_REASSOCIATION_K` times the replicated fit's
    own response to one reordering of its three-centre sum (blocks cut per
    shell, summed in reverse)
  * the quasiparticle window [explicit] and the whole ISDF BSE [context] on
    the row `SlicedFactors`: bitwise the same distributed solves on the
    one-rank fit's whole arrays, rank 0's on every rank, and within the
    anchored bar of the same solves on the replicated fit's `SlicedFactors`,
    the roots' anchor floored at what the Davidson resolves
    (`roots_resolution`)
  * the shell block [context]: the rank that evaluated water's one block
    held its kept pairs' integrals and one call over them, the others none
  * the metric root on rank 0 [context]: D = M^T V^1/2 with the root formed
    on rank 0 alone (`RowFit.metric_root_rows`) is every rank's rows of the
    one-rank run bitwise, the root held by rank 0 only and a slab of it
    elsewhere, and the whole-metric D to 1e-12
