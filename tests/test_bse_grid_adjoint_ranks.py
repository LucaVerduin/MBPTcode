"""The grid BSE adjoint (`LinearResponse.isdf_bse_adjoint`) distributed over
simulated ranks (`run_simulated`: threads of this process with the real
collectives), RHF/cc-pVDZ at 148 points per atom, on the chain's own roots
and vectors, the factors cut by `SlicedFactors.from_whole`:

  (a) THE SAME BITS AT EVERY RANK COUNT: eps_bar, X_bar, D_bar and W_bar of
      dOmega_0 and of the interstate element at 1, 2, 3 and 8 ranks, every
      rank's the one-rank run's, singlet and triplet, full and Tamm-Dancoff,
      water and ethylene, in the default 256-point tiles and in 64-point ones
      (more tiles than ranks); and the composed excitation force and
      interstate element of a sliced chain with `bse_adjoint='grid'` at 1, 2,
      3 and 8 ranks the same bits as the same chain whose grid adjoint every
      rank runs serially on the gathered factors, every rank rank 0's;
  (b) THE MEMORY SCAN: every frame under src/ traced line by line through
      the kernel on every rank at 2, 3 and 8 ranks, no array with the whole
      grid on an axis at any line outside the one named boundary gather of
      X_bar and D_bar (`adjoints_at_the_boundary`), no whole-factor gather,
      and the kernel's held-bytes ledger, read off its arrays, equal to this
      rank's rows and tiles entry by entry; the same scan finds the whole
      factors of the serial-replicated realization, so it can fail;
  (c) THE SHAPE-SENSITIVE BLAS: with the kernel's GEMMs scaled by one plus
      a multiple of their call shape (`ShapeSensitiveNumpy`, the stand-in of
      tests/test_frequency_rows_serial_shaped.py extended to every dimension),
      every rank at 2, 3 and 8 ranks is still bitwise the one-rank run under
      the same stand-in; the stand-in moves the result, and a tile of 128
      points in place of 256 moves it by far more than a last bit;
  (d) THE STREAMS: each tile computed by exactly one rank, broadcast once per
      pass (the column pass and the W_bar pass), each rank receiving every
      other rank's tiles once per pass, three halo and two hand-back row
      exchanges.

Measured on a two-thread workstation: every bitwise gate exact; under the
stand-in the adjoints move 3.9e-6 to 4.2e-6 off the real BLAS and a
128-point tile moves them 1.7e-6 to 1.8e-6 more, every rank still the
one-rank run's bits; the replicated adjoint in 128-point tiles moves the
composed force 9.0e-9 Ha/Bohr at 2 ranks by its seeds alone: they sit at
most 0.003 of the derived bound, and the fold of the default-tile seeds on
the reblocked run's pieces is the distributed force bitwise. A 1e-10
relative move of D_bar's largest element in the reblocked kernel puts its
seeds at 236 bounds while the force moves 6.8e-9, less than the clean
reblocking did; a dropped W_bar is 1.3e12 bounds; a 1e-12 change of W_bar in
the reblocked run's fold breaks the one-fold gate.

SHOWN TO FAIL, then restored and byte-compared (`cmp`): the kernel reading
its column tiles of D out of D gathered whole (`whole_factor(D, 'D')` before
the column pass, each tile sliced from it). The scan failed at 2, 3 and 8
ranks, D (444, 84) seen at the gather's line in `isdf_bse_backward_rows`
and in `sliced_factors._gathered`, `allgather_rows` and `allgather_blocks`,
while the bitwise gate stayed green: a gather moves bytes, not bits.
