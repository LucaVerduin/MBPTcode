"""The small-q limits of a 2D metal, and the mini-BZ measure to apply them.

src/SingleReference/Periodic/pbc_smallq.py. A slab is not a small 3D solid in
the long-wavelength limit: the bare interaction is 2pi/q, the dielectric head
diverges as 1/q rather than 1/q^2, the screened head is FINITE, and the plasmon
disperses as sqrt(q). Porting a 3D expression gives numbers that look
reasonable and are wrong, so every form here is checked against a published
limit rather than against itself.

Checks:
  1. Stern's 2D electron gas (PRL 18, 546 (1967)) as the reference limit:
     the static polarizability is CONSTANT below q = 2k_F, has the sqrt cusp
     at 2k_F, and falls as 1/q^2 above it. Feeding it through
     eps = 1 - v Pi reproduces 1 + kappa/q with kappa = 2 EXACTLY -- which is
     what fixes KAPPA_2DEG_FREE_ELECTRON and validates thomas_fermi_kappa_2d.
     The screened head v/eps is then 2pi/(q + kappa), finite at the origin.
  2. The mini-BZ measure: the disc average against numerical 2D quadrature,
     its two closed-form limits, and the mesh scaling of the disc radius.
  3. The disc average is NOT the 3D sphere average. Pinned deliberately: the
     published Gaussian-basis finite-size correction integrates over a sphere,
     which for a slab is the wrong domain, and the two differ by more than a
     convention -- they do not even have the same units of R.
  4. The sqrt(q) plasmon, and that it tends to ZERO rather than to the 3D
     constant.
  4b. The EXACT mini-BZ (Wigner-Seitz) average, against the disc it replaces
     and against 2D quadrature, plus an anisotropy check: a direction-dependent
     kappa is NOT the same as its
     angular mean, which is what makes an isotropic sqrt(q) form "the right
     scaling law with the wrong coefficient".
  5. The constant approximation kernel: it moves ONLY the head, keeps the
     kernel non-negative, carries the damping tag through so the
     damping-support check still reaches it, and reduces the AUTO-damped v(0) by a factor that is
     the SAME at every k-mesh -- because q_min * r0 = pi * frac_r0 is
     mesh-independent under the AUTO scheme. That invariance is the point: the
     constant approximation is a fixed redefinition of the Gamma head, not a
     correction that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.
  6. Admissibility on a real slab, which is the result the module exists to
     record: with the reaction field present, the head channel admits a value
     only up to a geometric ceiling. The bare mini-BZ head and the constant
     approximation both exceed it and drive the whitened metric indefinite;
     the METAL-SCREENED head does not. The ceiling is unchanged by the z-mesh,
     so it is not the "number of G_z points" the screening module's docstring
     blamed.
