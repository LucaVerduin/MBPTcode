"""Holding BLAS at one thread is a scheduling decision, not an arithmetic one.

`Base.utils.threads.blas_single_threaded` exists because pyscf's OpenMP pool
and the BLAS pool spin against each other: on sixteen cores the exchange build
and the exchange-correlation potential cost 1.90 and 10.38 s with both pools
wide and 0.04 and 0.63 s with BLAS at one. None of that may reach a number the
code returns. What the gates here pin:

  the wrap absent    without threadpoolctl the context manager is
                     `contextlib.nullcontext` and no thread count moves, so a
                     machine without the package runs the same code path.
  off the main
  thread             the same no-op. The count is process-global and the
                     simulated-rank tests put every rank in a thread of one
                     process, where one rank limiting BLAS re-associates its
                     neighbours' GEMMs: unguarded, that scattered the
                     excited-state chain's force by 1.3e-08 Ha/Bohr past the
                     1e-08 ISDF reproducibility floor it is gated at.
  the static term    BITWISE. `static_exchange_mean_field_matrix` under the
                     wrap against the same build with `threadpool_limits(1)`
                     set from OUTSIDE -- the same BLAS thread count, therefore
                     the same summation order, therefore the same bits. A
                     comparison against an UNLIMITED build would measure BLAS
                     re-association instead and would not be bitwise.
  the ISDF fit       the wrap sits around `aux_e2` alone, which is libcint's
                     OpenMP and calls no BLAS, so M and the factors it makes
                     come back bit for bit: measured 0.0 on water/cc-pVDZ, and
                     gated at 1e-12 relative. The gate has teeth -- widening
                     the wrap over the Gram matrix and the Cholesky solve moves
                     M by 2.3e-10 between one and two BLAS threads on
                     ethylene/cc-pVTZ, two orders past it, because the balanced
                     Gram matrix amplifies a re-associated sum by its
                     conditioning. That control runs below, on a fit large
                     enough that BLAS really does spread the Gram over cores
                     and with both counts set rather than assumed. The
                     per-block F D^T is left outside the wrap for the same
                     reason, though it is too small here for BLAS to thread and
                     the gate is silent on it: there the argument carries it,
                     not the measurement.
  the gate           the threshold lives in the context manager, not at the
                     call sites, so one rule covers all of them: below
                     `BLAS_WRAP_MIN_THREADS` there are too few cores for the
                     two pools to contend over, the wrap is its entry cost
                     alone (1-2 ms of rescanning the loaded pools), and it
                     stays a no-op. That is what keeps a workstation's records
                     bitwise -- an SCF wrapped at two threads moved a recorded
                     `xc_correction_eV` by 1e-16 and failed six of the
                     thirteen checks of the frozen record it is compared with.
                     `min_threads=1` arms it anyway, which is how the mechanics
                     above are exercised at two threads.

The thread count a test observes is the one its environment set, so nothing
here asserts a particular number of threads -- only that the wrap sets one
inside when it is armed, leaves it alone when it is not, and puts back what it
found.
