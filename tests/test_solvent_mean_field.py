"""The ground state a continuum accepts must be the one it relaxed.

Non-equilibrium solvation is TWO dielectric constants. The ground state relaxes
inside PCM(eps_static), because the solvent nuclei have had time to reorient
around a state that is already there; only the response to a fast excitation is
optical, and that is the vtilde `SolventScreening` hands out everywhere else.
Duchemin, Guido, Jacquemin and Blase, Chem. Sci. 9, 4430 (2018) split a
solvatochromic shift into those two halves, and for a local excitation the
ground-state half is the larger one.

`mean_field` applies it. It hands back a factory's own PCM mean field rather
than re-converging it, which is what lets a caller pass a solvated reference
straight through. A PCM at some OTHER dielectric constant is a different ground
state, though: keeping it would put the optical response at eps on top of a
reaction field built at the wrong constant, and nothing downstream can see that
it happened. So is a PCM at the right constant on ANOTHER cavity (method,
Lebedev order, sphere scale, radii): the optical response must sit on the
solute boundary the ground state relaxed in.

The cavity is PCM_LEBEDEV_ORDER = 11 (50 points per sphere) where pyscf's
default is 29 (302): the re-converged water in water moved from -76.03784008
to -76.03767760 Ha, a solvation energy of -9.94 -> -9.78 mHa, and no check
here pins that number -- they gate which ground state is built, not its value.
